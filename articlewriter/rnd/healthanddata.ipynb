The paper aims at analyzing the possibilities of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare. The research is based on a critical analysis of the literature, as well as the presentation of selected results of direct research on the use of Big Data Analytics in medical facilities. The direct research was carried out based on research questionnaire and conducted on a sample of 217 medical facilities in Poland. Literature studies have shown that the use of Big Data Analytics can bring many benefits to medical facilities, while direct research has shown that medical facilities in Poland are moving towards data-based healthcare because they use structured and unstructured data, reach for analytics in the administrative, business and clinical area. The research positively confirmed that medical facilities are working on both structural data and unstructured data. The following kinds and sources of data can be distinguished: from databases, transaction data, unstructured content of emails and documents, data from devices and sensors. However, the use of data from social media is lower as in their activity they reach for analytics, not only in the administrative and business but also in the clinical area. It clearly shows that the decisions made in medical facilities are highly data-driven. The results of the study confirm what has been analyzed in the literature that medical facilities are moving towards data-based healthcare, together with its benefits.\\n\\nKeywords: Big Data, Big Data Analytics, Data-driven healthcare\\nGo to:\\nIntroduction\\nThe main contribution of this paper is to present an analytical overview of using structured and unstructured data (Big Data) analytics in medical facilities in Poland. Medical facilities use both structured and unstructured data in their practice. Structured data has a predetermined schema, it is extensive, freeform, and comes in variety of forms [27]. In contrast, unstructured data, referred to as Big Data (BD), does not fit into the typical data processing format. Big Data is a massive amount of data sets that cannot be stored, processed, or analyzed using traditional tools. It remains stored but not analyzed. Due to the lack of a well-defined schema, it is difficult to search and analyze such data and, therefore, it requires a specific technology and method to transform it into value [20, 68]. Integrating data stored in both structured and unstructured formats can add significant value to an organization [27]. Organizations must approach unstructured data in a different way. Therefore, the potential is seen in Big Data Analytics (BDA). Big Data Analytics are techniques and tools used to analyze and extract information from Big Data. The results of Big Data analysis can be used to predict the future. They also help in creating trends about the past. When it comes to healthcare, it allows to analyze large datasets from thousands of patients, identifying clusters and correlation between datasets, as well as developing predictive models using data mining techniques [60].\\n\\nThis paper is the first study to consolidate and characterize the use of Big Data from different perspectives. The first part consists of a brief literature review of studies on Big Data (BD) and Big Data Analytics (BDA), while the second part presents results of direct research aimed at diagnosing the use of big data analyses in medical facilities in Poland.\\n\\nHealthcare is a complex system with varied stakeholders: patients, doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare decision-makers. This sector is also limited by strict rules and regulations. However, worldwide one may observe a departure from the traditional doctor-patient approach. The doctor becomes a partner and the patient is involved in the therapeutic process [14]. Healthcare is no longer focused solely on the treatment of patients. The priority for decision-makers should be to promote proper health attitudes and prevent diseases that can be avoided [81]. This became visible and important especially during the Covid-19 pandemic [44].\\n\\nThe next challenges that healthcare will have to face is the growing number of elderly people and a decline in fertility. Fertility rates in the country are found below the reproductive minimum necessary to keep the population stable [10]. The reflection of both effects, namely the increase in age and lower fertility rates, are demographic load indicators, which is constantly growing. Forecasts show that providing healthcare in the form it is provided today will become impossible in the next 20 years [70]. It is especially visible now during the Covid-19 pandemic when healthcare faced quite a challenge related to the analysis of huge data amounts and the need to identify trends and predict the spread of the coronavirus. The pandemic showed it even more that patients should have access to information about their health condition, the possibility of digital analysis of this data and access to reliable medical support online. Health monitoring and cooperation with doctors in order to prevent diseases can actually revolutionize the healthcare system.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5299, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The pandemic showed it even more that patients should have access to information about their health condition, the possibility of digital analysis of this data and access to reliable medical support online. Health monitoring and cooperation with doctors in order to prevent diseases can actually revolutionize the healthcare system. One of the most important aspects of the change necessary in healthcare is putting the patient in the center of the system.\\n\\nTechnology is not enough to achieve these goals. Therefore, changes should be made not only at the technological level but also in the management and design of complete healthcare processes and what is more, they should affect the business models of service providers. The use of Big Data Analytics is becoming more and more common in enterprises [17, 54]. However, medical enterprises still cannot keep up with the information needs of patients, clinicians, administrators and the creator’s policy. The adoption of a Big Data approach would allow the implementation of personalized and precise medicine based on personalized information, delivered in real time and tailored to individual patients.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement systems that will be able to learn quickly about the data generated by people within clinical care and everyday life. This will enable data-driven decision making, receiving better personalized predictions about prognosis and responses to treatments; a deeper understanding of the complex factors and their interactions that influence health at the patient level, the health system and society, enhanced approaches to detecting safety problems with drugs and devices, as well as more effective methods of comparing prevention, diagnostic, and treatment options [40].\\n\\nIn the literature, there is a lot of research showing what opportunities can be offered to companies by big data analysis and what data can be analyzed. However, there are few studies showing how data analysis in the area of healthcare is performed, what data is used by medical facilities and what analyses and in which areas they carry out. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting the results of research carried out in medical facilities in Poland. The goal is to analyze the possibilities of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare, especially in Polish conditions. In particular, the paper is aimed at determining what data is processed by medical facilities in Poland, what analyses they perform and in what areas, and how they assess their analytical maturity. In order to achieve this goal, a critical analysis of the literature was performed, and the direct research was based on a research questionnaire conducted on a sample of 217 medical facilities in Poland. It was hypothesized that medical facilities in Poland are working on both structured and unstructured data and moving towards data-based healthcare and its benefits. Examining the maturity of healthcare facilities in the use of Big Data and Big Data Analytics is crucial in determining the potential future benefits that the healthcare sector can gain from Big Data Analytics. There is also a pressing need to predicate whether, in the coming years, healthcare will be able to cope with the threats and challenges it faces.\\n\\nThis paper is divided into eight parts. The first is the introduction which provides background and the general problem statement of this research. In the second part, this paper discusses considerations on use of Big Data and Big Data Analytics in Healthcare, and then, in the third part, it moves on to challenges and potential benefits of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare. The next part involves the explanation of the proposed method. The result of direct research and discussion are presented in the fifth part, while the following part of the paper is the conclusion.

This trend is also noticeable in the analysis of large volumes of data (Big Data, BD). Organizations are looking for ways to use the power of Big Data to improve their decision making, competitive advantage or business performance [7, 54]. Big Data is considered to offer potential solutions to public and private organizations, however, still not much is known about the outcome of the practical use of Big Data in different types of organizations [24].\\n\\nAs already mentioned, in recent years, healthcare management worldwide has been changed from a disease-centered model to a patient-centered model, even in value-based healthcare delivery model [68]. In order to meet the requirements of this model and provide effective patient-centered care, it is necessary to manage and analyze healthcare Big Data.\\n\\nThe issue often raised when it comes to the use of data in healthcare is the appropriate use of Big Data. Healthcare has always generated huge amounts of data and nowadays, the introduction of electronic medical records, as well as the huge amount of data sent by various types of sensors or generated by patients in social media causes data streams to constantly grow. Also, the medical industry generates significant amounts of data, including clinical records, medical images, genomic data and health behaviors. Proper use of the data will allow healthcare organizations to support clinical decision-making, disease surveillance, and public health management. The challenge posed by clinical data processing involves not only the quantity of data but also the difficulty in processing it.\\n\\nIn the literature one can find many different definitions of Big Data. This concept has evolved in recent years, however, it is still not clearly understood. Nevertheless, despite the range and differences in definitions, Big Data can be treated as a: large amount of digital data, large data sets, tool, technology or phenomenon (cultural or technological.\\n\\nBig Data can be considered as massive and continually generated digital datasets that are produced via interactions with online technologies [53]. Big Data can be defined as datasets that are of such large sizes that they pose challenges in traditional storage and analysis techniques [28]. A similar opinion about Big Data was presented by Ohlhorst who sees Big Data as extremely large data sets, possible neither to manage nor to analyze with traditional data processing tools [57]. In his opinion, the bigger the data set, the more difficult it is to gain any value from it.\\n\\nIn turn, Knapp perceived Big Data as tools, processes and procedures that allow an organization to create, manipulate and manage very large data sets and storage facilities [38]. From this point of view, Big Data is identified as a tool to gather information from different databases and processes, allowing users to manage large amounts of data.\\n\\nSimilar perception of the term ‘Big Data’ is shown by Carter. According to him, Big Data technologies refer to a new generation of technologies and architectures, designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data by enabling high velocity capture, discovery and/or analysis [13].\\n\\nJordan combines these two approaches by identifying Big Data as a complex system, as it needs data bases for data to be stored in, programs and tools to be managed, as well as expertise and personnel able to retrieve useful information and visualization to be understood [37].\\n\\nFollowing the definition of Laney for Big Data, it can be state that: it is large amount of data generated in very fast motion and it contains a lot of content [43]. Such data comes from unstructured sources, such as stream of clicks on the web, social networks (Twitter, blogs, Facebook), video recordings from the shops, recording of calls in a call center, real time information from various kinds of sensors, RFID, GPS devices, mobile phones and other devices that identify and monitor something [8]. Big Data is a powerful digital data silo, raw, collected with all sorts of sources, unstructured and difficult, or even impossible, to analyze using conventional techniques used so far to relational databases.\\n\\nWhile describing Big Data, it cannot be overlooked that the term refers more to a phenomenon than to specific technology.', start_char_idx=8630, end_char_idx=13495, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Big Data is a powerful digital data silo, raw, collected with all sorts of sources, unstructured and difficult, or even impossible, to analyze using conventional techniques used so far to relational databases.\\n\\nWhile describing Big Data, it cannot be overlooked that the term refers more to a phenomenon than to specific technology. Therefore, instead of defining this phenomenon, trying to describe them, more authors are describing Big Data by giving them characteristics included a collection of V’s related to its nature [2, 3, 23, 25, 58]:\\n\\nVolume (refers to the amount of data and is one of the biggest challenges in Big Data Analytics),\\nVelocity (speed with which new data is generated, the challenge is to be able to manage data effectively and in real time),\\nVariety (heterogeneity of data, many different types of healthcare data, the challenge is to derive insights by looking at all available heterogenous data in a holistic manner),\\nVariability (inconsistency of data, the challenge is to correct the interpretation of data that can vary significantly depending on the context),\\nVeracity (how trustworthy the data is, quality of the data),\\nVisualization (ability to interpret data and resulting insights, challenging for Big Data due to its other features as described above).\\nValue (the goal of Big Data Analytics is to discover the hidden knowledge from huge amounts of data).\\nBig Data is defined as an information asset with high volume, velocity, and variety, which requires specific technology and method for its transformation into value [21, 77]. Big Data is also a collection of information about high-volume, high volatility or high diversity, requiring new forms of processing in order to support decision-making, discovering new phenomena and process optimization [5, 7]. Big Data is too large for traditional data-processing systems and software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze, therefore it requires new technologies [28, 50, 61] to manage (capture, aggregate, process) its volume, velocity and variety [9].\\n\\nUndoubtedly, Big Data differs from the data sources used so far by organizations. Therefore, organizations must approach this type of unstructured data in a different way. First of all, organizations must start to see data as flows and not stocks—this entails the need to implement the so-called streaming analytics [48]. The mentioned features make it necessary to use new IT tools that allow the fullest use of new data [58]. The Big Data idea, inseparable from the huge increase in data available to various organizations or individuals, creates opportunities for access to valuable analyses, conclusions and enables making more accurate decisions [6, 11, 59].\\n\\nThe Big Data concept is constantly evolving and currently it does not focus on huge amounts of data, but rather on the process of creating value from this data [52]. Big Data is collected from various sources that have different data properties and are processed by different organizational units, resulting in creation of a Big Data chain [36]. The aim of the organizations is to manage, process and analyze Big Data. In the healthcare sector, Big Data streams consist of various types of data, namely [8, 51]:\\n\\nclinical data, i.e. data obtained from electronic medical records, data from hospital information systems, image centers, laboratories, pharmacies and other organizations providing health services, patient generated health data, physician’s free-text notes, genomic data, physiological monitoring data [4],\\nbiometric data provided from various types of devices that monitor weight, pressure, glucose level, etc.,\\nfinancial data, constituting a full record of economic operations reflecting the conducted activity,\\ndata from scientific research activities, i.e. results of research, including drug research, design of medical devices and new methods of treatment,\\ndata provided by patients, including description of preferences, level of satisfaction, information from systems for self-monitoring of their activity: exercises, sleep, meals consumed, etc.\\ndata from social media.\\nThese data are provided not only by patients but also by organizations and institutions, as well as by various types of monitoring devices, sensors or instruments [16]. Data that has been generated so far in the healthcare sector is stored in both paper and digital form. Thus, the essence and the specificity of the process of Big Data analyses means that organizations need to face new technological and organizational challenges [67].', start_char_idx=12658, end_char_idx=17703, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Data that has been generated so far in the healthcare sector is stored in both paper and digital form. Thus, the essence and the specificity of the process of Big Data analyses means that organizations need to face new technological and organizational challenges [67]. The healthcare sector has always generated huge amounts of data and this is connected, among others, with the need to store medical records of patients. However, the problem with Big Data in healthcare is not limited to an overwhelming volume but also an unprecedented diversity in terms of types, data formats and speed with which it should be analyzed in order to provide the necessary information on an ongoing basis [3]. It is also difficult to apply traditional tools and methods for management of unstructured data [67]. Due to the diversity and quantity of data sources that are growing all the time, advanced analytical tools and technologies, as well as Big Data analysis methods which can meet and exceed the possibilities of managing healthcare data, are needed [3, 68].\\n\\nTherefore, the potential is seen in Big Data analyses, especially in the aspect of improving the quality of medical care, saving lives or reducing costs [30]. Extracting from this tangle of given association rules, patterns and trends will allow health service providers and other stakeholders in the healthcare sector to offer more accurate and more insightful diagnoses of patients, personalized treatment, monitoring of the patients, preventive medicine, support of medical research and health population, as well as better quality of medical services and patient care while, at the same time, the ability to reduce costs (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\\nObject name is 40537_2021_553_Fig1_HTML.jpg\\nFig. 1\\nHealthcare Big Data Analytics applications\\n\\n(Source: Own elaboration)\\n\\nThe main challenge with Big Data is how to handle such a large amount of information and use it to make data-driven decisions in plenty of areas [64]. In the context of healthcare data, another major challenge is to adjust big data storage, analysis, presentation of analysis results and inference basing on them in a clinical setting. Data analytics systems implemented in healthcare are designed to describe, integrate and present complex data in an appropriate way so that it can be understood better (Fig. 2). This would improve the efficiency of acquiring, storing, analyzing and visualizing big data from healthcare [71].\\n\\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\\nObject name is 40537_2021_553_Fig2_HTML.jpg\\nFig. 2\\nProcess of Big Data Analytics\\n\\n(Source: Own elaboration)\\n\\nThe result of data processing with the use of Big Data Analytics is appropriate data storytelling which may contribute to making decisions with both lower risk and data support. This, in turn, can benefit healthcare stakeholders. To take advantage of the potential massive amounts of data in healthcare and to ensure that the right intervention to the right patient is properly timed, personalized, and potentially beneficial to all components of the healthcare system such as the payer, patient, and management, analytics of large datasets must connect communities involved in data analytics and healthcare informatics [49]. Big Data Analytics can provide insight into clinical data and thus facilitate informed decision-making about the diagnosis and treatment of patients, prevention of diseases or others. Big Data Analytics can also improve the efficiency of healthcare organizations by realizing the data potential [3, 62].\\n\\nBig Data Analytics in medicine and healthcare refers to the integration and analysis of a large amount of complex heterogeneous data, such as various omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, interactomics, pharmacogenetics, deasomics), biomedical data, talemedicine data (sensors, medical equipment data) and electronic health records data [46, 65].\\n\\nWhen analyzing the phenomenon of Big Data in the healthcare sector, it should be noted that it can be considered from the point of view of three areas: epidemiological, clinical and business.\\n\\nFrom a clinical point of view, the Big Data analysis aims to improve the health and condition of patients, enable long-term predictions about their health status and implementation of appropriate therapeutic procedures.

It is worth noting that Big Data means not only the collection and processing of data but, most of all, the inference and visualization of data necessary to obtain specific business benefits.\\n\\nIn order to introduce new management methods and new solutions in terms of effectiveness and transparency, it becomes necessary to make data more accessible, digital, searchable, as well as analyzed and visualized.\\n\\nErickson and Rothberg state that the information and data do not reveal their full value until insights are drawn from them. Data becomes useful when it enhances decision making and decision making is enhanced only when analytical techniques are used and an element of human interaction is applied [22].\\n\\nThus, healthcare has experienced much progress in usage and analysis of data. A large-scale digitalization and transparency in this sector is a key statement of almost all countries governments policies. For centuries, the treatment of patients was based on the judgment of doctors who made treatment decisions. In recent years, however, Evidence-Based Medicine has become more and more important as a result of it being related to the systematic analysis of clinical data and decision-making treatment based on the best available information [42]. In the healthcare sector, Big Data Analytics is expected to improve the quality of life and reduce operational costs [72, 82]. Big Data Analytics enables organizations to improve and increase their understanding of the information contained in data. It also helps identify data that provides insightful insights for current as well as future decisions [28].\\n\\nBig Data Analytics refers to technologies that are grounded mostly in data mining: text mining, web mining, process mining, audio and video analytics, statistical analysis, network analytics, social media analytics and web analytics [16, 25, 31]. Different data mining techniques can be applied on heterogeneous healthcare data sets, such as: anomaly detection, clustering, classification, association rules as well as summarization and visualization of those Big Data sets [65]. Modern data analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data characteristics even from high-speed data streams and sensor data [15, 16, 31, 55]. Big Data can be used, for example, for better diagnosis in the context of comprehensive patient data, disease prevention and telemedicine (in particular when using real-time alerts for immediate care), monitoring patients at home, preventing unnecessary hospital visits, integrating medical imaging for a wider diagnosis, creating predictive analytics, reducing fraud and improving data security, better strategic planning and increasing patients’ involvement in their own health.\\n\\nBig Data Analytics in healthcare can be divided into [33, 73, 74]:\\n\\ndescriptive analytics in healthcare is used to understand past and current healthcare decisions, converting data into useful information for understanding and analyzing healthcare decisions, outcomes and quality, as well as making informed decisions [33]. It can be used to create reports (i.e. about patients’ hospitalizations, physicians’ performance, utilization management), visualization, customized reports, drill down tables, or running queries on the basis of historical data.\\npredictive analytics operates on past performance in an effort to predict the future by examining historical or summarized health data, detecting patterns of relationships in these data, and then extrapolating these relationships to forecast. It can be used to i.e. predict the response of different patient groups to different drugs (dosages) or reactions (clinical trials), anticipate risk and find relationships in health data and detect hidden patterns [62]. In this way, it is possible to predict the epidemic spread, anticipate service contracts and plan healthcare resources. Predictive analytics is used in proper diagnosis and for appropriate treatments to be given to patients suffering from certain diseases [39].\\nprescriptive analytics—occurs when health problems involve too many choices or alternatives. It uses health and medical knowledge in addition to data or information. Prescriptive analytics is used in many areas of healthcare, including drug prescriptions and treatment alternatives. Personalized medicine and evidence-based medicine are both supported by prescriptive analytics.\\ndiscovery analytics—utilizes knowledge about knowledge to discover new “inventions” like drugs (drug discovery), previously unknown diseases and medical conditions, alternative treatments, etc.', start_char_idx=21413, end_char_idx=26929, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Big Data Analytics in healthcare can help enable personalized medicine by identifying optimal patient-specific treatments. This can influence the improvement of life standards, reduce waste of healthcare resources and save costs of healthcare [56, 63, 71]. The introduction of large data analysis gives new analytical possibilities in terms of scope, flexibility and visualization. Techniques such as data mining (computational pattern discovery process in large data sets) facilitate inductive reasoning and analysis of exploratory data, enabling scientists to identify data patterns that are independent of specific hypotheses. As a result, predictive analysis and real-time analysis becomes possible, making it easier for medical staff to start early treatments and reduce potential morbidity and mortality. In addition, document analysis, statistical modeling, discovering patterns and topics in document collections and data in the EHR, as well as an inductive approach can help identify and discover relationships between health phenomena.\\n\\nAdvanced analytical techniques can be used for a large amount of existing (but not yet analytical) data on patient health and related medical data to achieve a better understanding of the information and results obtained, as well as to design optimal clinical pathways [62]. Big Data Analytics in healthcare integrates analysis of several scientific areas such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, sensor informatics, medical informatics and health informatics [65]. Big Data Analytics in healthcare allows to analyze large datasets from thousands of patients, identifying clusters and correlation between datasets, as well as developing predictive models using data mining techniques [65]. Discussing all the techniques used for Big Data Analytics goes beyond the scope of a single article [25].\\n\\nThe success of Big Data analysis and its accuracy depend heavily on the tools and techniques used to analyze the ability to provide reliable, up-to-date and meaningful information to various stakeholders [12]. It is believed that the implementation of big data analytics by healthcare organizations could bring many benefits in the upcoming years, including lowering health care costs, better diagnosis and prediction of diseases and their spread, improving patient care and developing protocols to prevent re-hospitalization, optimizing staff, optimizing equipment, forecasting the need for hospital beds, operating rooms, treatments, and improving the drug supply chain [71].\\n\\nGo to:\\nChallenges and potential benefits of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare\\nModern analytics gives possibilities not only to have insight in historical data, but also to have information necessary to generate insight into what may happen in the future. Even when it comes to prediction of evidence-based actions. The emphasis on reform has prompted payers and suppliers to pursue data analysis to reduce risk, detect fraud, improve efficiency and save lives. Everyone—payers, providers, even patients—are focusing on doing more with fewer resources. Thus, some areas in which enhanced data and analytics can yield the greatest results include various healthcare stakeholders (Table \\u200b(Table11).\\n\\nTable 1\\nThe use of analytics by various healthcare stakeholders\\n\\nSource: own elaboration on the basis of [19, 20]\\n\\nThe use of analytics by healthcare providers\\tHealthcare providers are the main recipients and users of analytical systems in healthcare.

Thanks to analytics, medical centers will have a complete picture of their activities, taking into account the clinical, management, financial and quality perspectives\\nThe use of analytics by the Payer\\tThe analytics will allow payers to develop plans for managing health and preventive programs, so it can be a factor in improving the quality of patients' health insurance and improving the health and quality of life of insured persons. It will be possible to carry out analyses allowing to determine the structure and cost-effectiveness of medical procedures for a given disease or the risk of its occurrence. Access to cross-sectional information about the consumers will enable payers to identify factors (genetic, demographic or environmental) affecting the emergence and development of specific diseases. It will allow to plan contracting services and implement information and preventive programs, as well as informing patients what diseases they might come across or what are the risks\\nAnalytics in the field of Life Sciences\\tIn pharmaceutical forms and companies producing medical equipment, analytics has been used for several years, as these industries evolve very quickly. Current analytical systems are slowly adapting to the challenges of personalized medicine, allowing the adaptation of treatments, prophylaxis to individual patient genomes, their proteomes and metabolic attributes. Effective solutions in this area have not yet been fully developed. Pharmaceutical companies also use drug sales data to plan marketing activities to achieve greater sales efficiency\\nThe use of analytics by patients\\tPatients are the final recipients of healthcare, so they will also have to become. Analytics may be useful for finding the best medical facilities and doctors, checking the effectiveness of treatments and medicines ordered, as well as comparing the price and quality of offers of different providers and selecting the best one. The analytical capabilities in the patient area are of course related to the introduction of the Health 2.0 concept thanks to which patients have access to health information from the level of a web browser and can use analytical systems in the same way. Analytical reports will have to be simplified so that patients can understand them\\nOpen in a separate window\\nHealthcare organizations see the opportunity to grow through investments in Big Data Analytics. In recent years, by collecting medical data of patients, converting them into Big Data and applying appropriate algorithms, reliable information has been generated that helps patients, physicians and stakeholders in the health sector to identify values and opportunities [31]. It is worth noting that there are many changes and challenges in the structure of the healthcare sector. Digitization and effective use of Big Data in healthcare can bring benefits to every stakeholder in this sector. A single doctor would benefit the same as the entire healthcare system.

Shortened list of benefits for Big Data Analytics in healthcare is presented in paper [3] and consists of: better performance, day-to-day guides, detection of diseases in early stages, making predictive analytics, cost effectiveness, Evidence Based Medicine and effectiveness in patient treatment.\\n\\nSummarizing, healthcare big data represents a huge potential for the transformation of healthcare: improvement of patients’ results, prediction of outbreaks of epidemics, valuable insights, avoidance of preventable diseases, reduction of the cost of healthcare delivery and improvement of the quality of life in general [1]. Big Data also generates many challenges such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization [15]. The main challenges are connected with the issues of: data structure (Big Data should be user-friendly, transparent, and menu-driven but it is fragmented, dispersed, rarely standardized and difficult to aggregate and analyze), security (data security, privacy and sensitivity of healthcare data, there are significant concerns related to confidentiality), data standardization (data is stored in formats that are not compatible with all applications and technologies), storage and transfers (especially costs associated with securing, storing, and transferring unstructured data), managerial skills, such as data governance, lack of appropriate analytical skills and problems with Real-Time Analytics (health care is to be able to utilize Big Data in real time) [4, 34, 41].\\n\\nGo to:\\nMethods\\nThe research is based on a critical analysis of the literature, as well as the presentation of selected results of direct research on the use of Big Data Analytics in medical facilities in Poland.\\n\\nPresented research results are part of a larger questionnaire form on Big Data Analytics. The direct research was based on an interview questionnaire which contained 100 questions with 5-point Likert scale (1—strongly disagree, 2—I rather disagree, 3—I do not agree, nor disagree, 4—I rather agree, 5—I definitely agree) and 4 metrics questions. The study was conducted in December 2018 on a sample of 217 medical facilities (110 private, 107 public). The research was conducted by a specialized market research agency: Center for Research and Expertise of the University of Economics in Katowice.\\n\\nWhen it comes to direct research, the selected entities included entities financed from public sources—the National Health Fund (23.5%), and entities operating commercially (11.5%). In the surveyed group of entities, more than a half (64.9%) are hybrid financed, both from public and commercial sources. The diversity of the research sample also applies to the size of the entities, defined by the number of employees. Taking into account proportions of the surveyed entities, it should be noted that in the sector structure, medium-sized (10–50 employees—34% of the sample) and large (51–250 employees—27%) entities dominate. The research was of all-Poland nature, and the entities included in the research sample come from all of the voivodships. The largest group were entities from Łódzkie (32%), Śląskie (18%) and Mazowieckie (18%) voivodships, as these voivodships have the largest number of medical institutions. Other regions of the country were represented by single units. The selection of the research sample was random—layered. As part of medical facilities database, groups of private and public medical facilities have been identified and the ones to which the questionnaire was targeted were drawn from each of these groups. The analyses were performed using the GNU PSPP 0.10.2 software.\\n\\nThe aim of the study was to determine whether medical facilities in Poland use Big Data Analytics and if so, in which areas.

Medical facilities in Poland are working on both structured and unstructured data. This data comes from databases, transactions, unstructured content of emails and documents, devices and sensors. However, the use of data from social media is smaller. In their activity, they reach for analytics in the administrative and business, as well as in the clinical area. Also, the decisions made are largely data-driven.\\n\\nIn summary, analysis of the literature that the benefits that medical facilities can get using Big Data Analytics in their activities relate primarily to patients, physicians and medical facilities. It can be confirmed that: patients will be better informed, will receive treatments that will work for them, will have prescribed medications that work for them and not be given unnecessary medications [78]. Physician roles will likely change to more of a consultant than decision maker. They will advise, warn, and help individual patients and have more time to form positive and lasting relationships with their patients in order to help people. Medical facilities will see changes as well, for example in fewer unnecessary hospitalizations, resulting initially in less revenue, but after the market adjusts, also the accomplishment [78]. The use of Big Data Analytics can literally revolutionize the way healthcare is practiced for better health and disease reduction.\\n\\nThe analysis of the latest data reveals that data analytics increase the accuracy of diagnoses. Physicians can use predictive algorithms to help them make more accurate diagnoses [45]. Moreover, it could be helpful in preventive medicine and public health because with early intervention, many diseases can be prevented or ameliorated [29]. Predictive analytics also allows to identify risk factors for a given patient, and with this knowledge patients will be able to change their lives what, in turn, may contribute to the fact that population disease patterns may dramatically change, resulting in savings in medical costs. Moreover, personalized medicine is the best solution for an individual patient seeking treatment. It can help doctors decide the exact treatments for those individuals. Better diagnoses and more targeted treatments will naturally lead to increases in good outcomes and fewer resources used, including doctors’ time.\\n\\nGo to:\\nConclusion\\nThe quantitative analysis of the research carried out and presented in this article made it possible to determine whether medical facilities in Poland use Big Data Analytics and if so, in which areas. Thanks to the results obtained it was possible to formulate the following conclusions. Medical facilities are working on both structured and unstructured data, which comes from databases, transactions, unstructured content of emails and documents, devices and sensors. According to analytics, they reach for analytics in the administrative and business, as well as in the clinical area. It clearly showed that the decisions made are largely data-driven. The results of the study confirm what has been analyzed in the literature. Medical facilities are moving towards data-based healthcare and its benefits.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Big Data Analytics has the potential for positive impact and global implications in healthcare.

Improving health outcomes while containing costs acts as a stumbling block. In this context, Big Data can help healthcare providers meet these goals in unprecedented ways. The potential of Big Data in healthcare relies on the ability to detect patterns and to turn high volumes of data into actionable knowledge for precision medicine and decision makers. In several contexts, the use of Big Data in healthcare is already offering solutions for the improvement of patient care and the generation of value in healthcare organizations. This approach requires, however, that all the relevant stakeholders collaborate and adapt the design and performance of their systems. They must build the technological infrastructure to house and converge the massive volume of healthcare data, and to invest in the human capital to guide citizens into this new frontier of human health and well-being. The present work reports an overview of best practice initiatives in Europe related to Big Data analytics in public health and oncology sectors, aimed to generate new knowledge, improve clinical care and streamline public health surveillance.\\n\\nGo to:\\nIntroduction\\nData have become an omnipresent concept in our daily lives with the routine collection, storage, processing and analysis of immense amount of data. This characteristic is cross-sectorial, ranging from the domain of machine learning and engineering, to economics and medicine.\\n\\nOver the last decades, there has been growing enthusiasm of the potential usefulness of these massive quantities of data, called Big Data, in transforming personal care, clinical care and public health.1\\n\\nAn overview of Big Data definitions\\nDespite the term Big Data having become ubiquitous, there is no universal definition until now on the use of this term. According to McKinsey the term Big Data refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyse.2 Gartner proposed the popular definition of Big Data with the ‘3V’: Big Data is volume, high-velocity and high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing for enhanced insight and decision making.3 According to other definitions, instead, Big Data is also characterized by a fourth dimension: Veracity, concerning the quality, authenticity, ‘trustworthiness’ of data.4\\n\\nFurthermore, there is an emergent discussion that ‘Big’ is no longer the defining parameter, but rather how ‘smart’ the data are, focusing on the insights that the volume of data can reasonably provide.5 This aspect is fundamental in the health sector. The potential of Big Data in improving health is enormous. However, its potential value is unlocked only when leveraged to drive decision making and, to enable such evidence-based decision making, it is necessary to have efficient processes to analyse and turn high volumes of data into meaningful insights.\\n\\nA specific definition of what Big Data means for health research was proposed by the Health Directorate of the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation of the European Commission: Big Data in health encompasses high volume, high diversity biological, clinical, environmental, and lifestyle information collected from single individuals to large cohorts, in relation to their health and wellness status, at one or several time points.6\\n\\nBig Data analytics for health systems\\nThe complexity of Big Data analysis arises from combining different types of information, which are electronically captured. The last years have seen an explosion of new platforms, tools and methodologies in storing, and structuring such data, followed by a growth of publications on Big Data and Health (figure 1). To date, we can collect data from electronic healthcare records, social media, patient summaries, genomic and pharmaceutical data, clinical trials, telemedicine, mobile apps, sensors and information on well-being, behaviour and socio-economic indicators.\\n\\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\\nObject name is ckz168f1.jpg\\nFigure 1\\nNumber of publications on ‘Big Data and health’ reported by year (from 2010 to 2018).

The publications are identified through a search of MEDLINE with the following terms for the literature search: (‘Big Data’) AND (‘Health’)\\n\\nHealthcare professionals can, therefore, benefit from an incredibly large amount of data. Recent reports suggest that US healthcare system alone stored around a total of 150 exabytes of data in 2011 with the perspective to reach the yottabyte.7\\n\\nStarting with the collection of individual data elements and moving to the fusion of heterogeneous data coming from different sources, can reveal entirely new approaches to improve health by providing insights into the causes and outcomes of disease, better drug targets for precision medicine, and enhanced disease prediction and prevention.\\n\\nIn light of this, opportunities and potential are enormous for the benefit of patients and, in general, of the healthcare system.\\n\\nThe potential benefits of Big Data for healthcare in the European Union\\nBig Data is a sensitive issue for European Union (EU) institutions: the availability of health-related Big Data can have a positive impact on medical and healthcare functions. EU is faced with several changes that may affect the sustainability of its healthcare system. By 2025 life expectancy is expected to further increase, and this may result in more people living longer, but not necessarily in a healthy and active condition. This will put further pressure on Europe’s healthcare costs and economic productivity.\\n\\nIn this context, the data sharing approach can improve outcomes for patients and evidence-based healthcare decision making as reported during the workshop on ‘Digitalisation and Big Data: implications for the health sector’, held on 19 June 2018 at the European Parliament.8\\n\\nThe use of Big Data in healthcare, in fact, can contribute at different levels as reported by the Study on Big Data in Public Health, Telemedicine and Healthcare of the European Commission:9 (i) increasing earlier diagnosis and the effectiveness and quality of treatments by the discovery of early signals and disease intervention, reduced probability of adverse reactions, etc. (sector 1); (ii) widening possibilities for prevention of diseases by identification of risk factors for disease (sector 2); (iii) improvement of pharmacovigilance and patient safety through the ability to make more informed medical decisions based on directly delivered information to the patients (sector 3); (iv) prediction of outcomes (sector 4).\\n\\nIn the next paragraphs, examples of EU initiatives in the four macro sectors are listed.\\n\\nBig Data have the potential to yield new insights into risk factors that lead to disease. There is the possibility to engage with the individual patient more closely and import data from mobile health applications or connected devices. These data have the potential to be analysed and used in real-time to prompt changes in behaviours that can reduce health risks, reduce harmful environmental exposures or optimize health outcomes.\\n\\nFinally, Big Data can help identify and promptly intervene on high-risk and high-cost patients.10 Effective ways of managing these data can therefore facilitate precision medicine by enabling detection of heterogeneity in patient responses to treatments and tailoring of healthcare to the specific needs of individuals.11 All these aspects should eventually lead to a reduction in inefficiency and improvement in cost containment for the healthcare system.\\n\\nExamples of Big Data analytics for new knowledge generation, improved clinical care and streamlined public health surveillance are already available. Below we report a selection of best practices in Europe in the public health and oncology fields.\\n\\nBig Data in public health\\nEfforts to improve the availability and accessibility of data in the EU appear to be driven mainly by socio-economic purposes. However, great importance is placed on the need of using data and new information and communication technology (ICT) in public health to improve quality of prevention and care.\\n\\nIn the next years, European health systems must respond more efficiently to the exponential increase of chronic patients identifying the most efficient interventions and releasing the full potential of ICT. The e-health platforms that many European governments are trying to implement can be effective in improving the management of chronic patients in the community setting by interfacing between different health professionals and specialists and with the patients. Furthermore, a large part of EU citizens uses the internet looking for information on health and access to health services.\\n\\nMoreover, Big Data and predictive analytics can contribute to precision public health by improving public health surveillance and assessment, therefore, in a public health perspective, the gathering of a very large amount of data, constitute an inestimable resource to be used in epidemiological research, analysis of the health needs of the population, evaluation of population-based intervention and informed policy making.9\\n\\nMany projects across the EU are exploring the potential of available Big Data in a wide range of fields.', start_char_idx=4255, end_char_idx=9526, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A systematic review published in 2016 from the European Commission identified at that time 10 priority projects on Big Data implemented in Europe that fall in the four macro sectors described above and are aimed to support the sustainability of health systems by addressing the improvement of the quality and effectiveness of treatment, fighting chronic disease and supporting healthy lifestyles.9 Some of these projects focussed on gathering a very wide range of data types, from GP records, hospitalizations, drug prescription and laboratory and radiology analyses in order to create comprehensive national data warehouses. Among them, the ‘Decision Support for Health Policy and Planning: Methods, Models and Technologies based on Existing Health Care Data’ (DEXHELPP), the eHealth project in Estonia, the ARNO observatory in Italy and the Hospital Episode Statistics in the United Kingdom. The DEXHELPP project (mainly regarding sectors 1 and 4) used routinely collected health data sources to analyse the performance of the health system, to forecast future changes and to simulate the application of policy and interventions. The Estonian eHealth project (mainly regarding sectors 1, 2 and 3) was more oriented toward the improvement of the quality and efficiency of health services, aiming to digitalize all the information and prescription of each patient. Furthermore, in order to facilitate data collection, they provide an environment called X-Road to which all healthcare providers can link while using their own ICT solutions. The ARNO project (mainly regarding sector 4), was committed to epidemiological research, giving the possibility of deep stratification of the general population. The Hospital Episode Statistics (mainly regarding sector 4) was in charge of the Secondary Uses Service that publishes reports and analyses to support the National Health Service in the delivery of healthcare services.\\n\\nBeside these projects characterized by a comprehensive approach, other initiatives focused on specific conditions (e.g. chronic conditions, rare diseases and psychiatric disorders) are also available in the EU.9 Among them, the PASSI surveillance project (mainly regarding sectors 1 and 2) in Italy provides large amount of information on the life style of almost the 90% of the population, enabling to individuate specific targets to implement and assess public health actions. The Shared Care Platform (mainly regarding sectors 1 and 3) in Denmark is focused on chronic patients, aiming to harmonize the course of treatment among health and social care providers. The Spanish Rare Diseases Registries Research Network (SpainRDR) (mainly regarding sector 1) focuses on the development of clinical research on rare diseases, providing the harmonization and unification into one comprehensive platform of pre-existing databases and registries of rare diseases. CEPHOS-LINK (mainly regarding sectors 1, 2 and 4), is a platform dedicated to mental health that involves six EU countries. It is committed to collect data on psychiatric hospital admissions and re-admissions, with the aim of finding determinants of re-admissions and to harmonize the psychiatric care pathways across the EU.\\n\\nIn addition to the projects reported above, the EU’s framework programmes for research and innovation funded a large number of initiatives on Big Data in public health.

According to the State of Health in the EU reports, cancer is recognized as one of the major contributors to premature deaths in the EU. It also has an impact on the economy in terms of lower labour market participation and productivity. Advances in Big Data analytics are given cancer researchers powerful new ways to extract value from diverse sources of data.\\n\\nThese diverse sources include a huge amount of data for one patient. As cancer is a molecularly highly complex disease with an enormous intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity among different cancer types and even patients, the collection of various different types of omics data can provide a unique molecular profile for each patient and significantly aid oncologists in their effort for personalized therapy approaches.12\\n\\nThe approach of combining these sources of data is implemented in Comprehensive Cancer Centres (CCCs).13 One of 13 CCCs in Germany is the National Center of Tumor Diseases, where the Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research (MASTER) trial is conducted (mainly regarding sector 1, 2 and 3). In a recent review article,14 this trial was illustrated as an example of a highly successful programme addressing the molecular profiling in cancer patients.

One of the main challenges of these collaborations is the access to the data as well as the opportunity to analyse the huge amount of data in an efficient way. Physicians, researchers and informatics experts can only benefit from collected data and expert knowledge when they get easy and intuitive access to own data or data of partners.

The review indicates that the use of health data for purposes other than treatment enjoys support among people, as long as the data are expected to further the common good. In this context, the recent call reported in Science from a number of eminent scientists worldwide, for the unrestricted use of public genomic data, finds a fertile ground from the public.18 Concerns evolve around the commercialization of data, data security and the use of data against the interests of the people providing the data.\\n\\nThe recent EU Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) tries to balance patients’ privacy while ensuring patient’s data can be shared for healthcare and research purposes.\\n\\nOn 23 January 2017 the Consultative Committee of the Council of Europe’s data protection convention adopted ‘Guidelines on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data in a world of Big Data’,19 the first document on privacy and Big Data which provides suggested measures for preventing any possible negative effects of the use of Big Data on human rights and freedoms.\\n\\nTherefore, any government that uses Big Data in the health sector needs to establish affirmative policies to protect the health data of individuals, in terms of confidentiality, privacy and security, while ensuring that advancements in science can take advantage from the open use of data for the community well-being.\\n\\nGo to:\\nConclusions\\nBig Data is beginning to revolutionize healthcare in Europe as it offers paths and solutions to improve health of individual persons as well as to improve the performance and outcomes of healthcare systems.\\n\\nThe implementation of precision medicine remains contingent on significant data acquisition and timely analysis to determine the most appropriate basis on which to tailor health optimization for individual prevention, diagnosis and disease treatment. Achieving effective and proportionate governance of health-related data will be essential for the future healthcare systems, and it requires that stakeholders collaborate and adapt the design and performance of their systems to reach the maximum innovative potential of information and innovation technology on health in the EU.\\n\\nIn this context, EU Member States should agree on international technical standards, taking also into account openness that is considered as the basic paradigm for digital transformation. Additionally, new approaches must be found for translating the vast amount of data into meaningful information that healthcare professionals can use. Further efforts must be made to make information for doctors and health professionals more accessible and understandable.\\n\\nTo achieve this, existing training and education programmes for healthcare professionals should integrate the issues of data handling in the curricula to ensure the development of the necessary skills and competencies. This is one of the objectives of the ‘European network staff eXchange for integrAting precision health in the health Care sysTems’ consortium (ExACT)20 project that aims to integrate precision health in European health systems by training a new generation of healthcare professionals across and outside of the EU.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we are living in fast-moving times, not least in terms of healthcare innovation. Whilst there are pressing needs for more personalized and sustainable health services, science and technology are offering a host of potentially invaluable new tools to deliver them.

One of the most notable areas where data analysis is making big changes is healthcare.\\n\\nIn fact, healthcare analytics has the potential to reduce costs of treatment, predict outbreaks of epidemics, avoid preventable diseases, and improve the quality of life in general. The average human lifespan is increasing across the world population, which poses new challenges to today’s treatment delivery methods. Health professionals, just like business entrepreneurs, are capable of collecting massive amounts of data and looking for the best strategies to use these numbers.\\n\\nIn this article, we’re going to address the need for big data in healthcare and hospital big data: why and how can it help? What are the obstacles to its adoption? We will then look at 24 big data examples in healthcare that already exist and that medical-based institutions can benefit from.\\n\\nBut first, let’s examine the core concept and role of big data in healthcare.\\n\\nWhat Is Big Data In Healthcare?\\nA big data in healthcare example of a modern patient dashboard\\nBig data in healthcare is a term used to describe massive volumes of information created by the adoption of digital technologies that collect patients' records and help in managing hospital performance; otherwise too large and complex for traditional technologies.\\n\\nThe application of big data analytics in healthcare has a lot of positive and also life-saving outcomes. In essence, big-style data refers to the vast quantities of information created by the digitization of everything that gets consolidated and analyzed by specific technologies. Applied to healthcare, it will use specific health data of a population (or of a particular individual) and potentially help to prevent epidemics, cure diseases, cut down costs, etc.\\n\\nNow that we live longer, treatment models have changed, and many of these changes are namely driven by data. Doctors want to understand as much as they can about a person and, as early in their life as possible, to pick up warning signs of serious illness as they arise – treating any disease at an early stage is far more simple and less expensive. By utilizing key performance indicators in healthcare and healthcare data analytics, prevention is better than cure, and managing to draw a comprehensive picture of someone will let insurance provide a tailored package. This is the industry’s attempt to tackle the siloes problems a patient’s data has: everywhere are collected bits and bites of it and archived in hospitals, clinics, surgeries, etc., with the impossibility of communicating properly. \\n\\nThat said, the amount of sources from which health professionals can gain insights from their patients keeps growing. This data is normally coming in different formats and sizes, which presents a challenge to the user. However, the current focus is no longer on how “big” the data is but on how smartly it is managed. With the help of the right technology, data can be extracted from the following sources of the healthcare industry in a smart and fast way: \\n\\nPatients portals \\nResearch studies \\nEHRs\\nWearable devices\\nSearch engines\\nGeneric databases \\nGovernment agencies \\nPayer records \\nStaffing schedules \\nPatient waiting room \\nIndeed, for years gathering huge amounts of data for medical use has been costly and time-consuming. With today’s always-improving technologies, it becomes easier not only to collect such data but also to create comprehensive healthcare reports and convert them into relevant critical insights that can then be used to provide better care. This is the purpose of healthcare data analysis: using data-driven findings to predict and solve a problem before it is too late, but also assess methods and treatments faster, keep better track of inventory, involve patients more in their own health, and empower them with the tools to do so.\\n\\n24 Big Data Applications In Healthcare\\n24 Big data in healthcare applications of the real world \\nNow that you understand the importance of big data in the healthcare industry let’s explore 24 real-world applications that demonstrate how an analytical approach can improve processes, enhance patient care, and, ultimately, save lives.\\n\\n1) Patients Predictions For Improved Staffing\\nFor our first example of big data in healthcare, we will look at one classic problem that any shift manager faces: how many people do I put on staff at any given period?

If you put on too many workers, you run the risk of having unnecessary labor costs add up. With too few workers, you can have poor customer service outcomes – which can be fatal for patients in that industry.\\n\\nHealthcare data analytics help predict the number of patients to improve staffing. This image shows an available medical professional measuring patients' blood pressure. \\nBig data is helping to solve this problem, at least at a few hospitals in Paris. A white paper by Intel details how four hospitals that are part of the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris have been using data from a variety of sources to come up with daily and hourly predictions of how many patients are expected to be at each facility.\\n\\nOne of the key data sets is 10 years’ worth of hospital admissions records, which data scientists crunched using “time series analysis” techniques. These analyses allowed the researchers to see relevant patterns in admission rates. Then, they could use machine learning to find the most accurate algorithms that predicted future admissions trends.\\n\\nSumming up the product of all this work, the data science team developed a web-based user interface that forecasts patient loads and helps in planning resource allocation by utilizing online data visualization that reaches the goal of improving the overall patients' care.\\n\\n2) Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\\nIt’s the most widespread application of big data in medicine. Every person has their own digital record, which includes demographics, medical history, allergies, laboratory test results, etc. Records are shared via secure information systems and are available for providers from both the public and private sectors. Every record is comprised of one modifiable file, which means that doctors can implement changes over time with no paperwork and no danger of data replication.\\n\\nEHRs can also trigger warnings and reminders when a patient should get a new lab test or track prescriptions to see if he or she has been following doctors’ orders.\\n\\nAlthough EHR is a great idea, many countries still struggle to implement them fully. U.S. has made a major leap, with 94% of hospitals adopting EHRs according to this HITECH research, but the EU still lags behind. However, an ambitious directive drafted by the European Commission is supposed to change it.\\n\\nKaiser Permanente is leading the way in the U.S. and could provide a model for the EU to follow. They’ve fully implemented a system called HealthConnect that shares data across all of their facilities and makes it easier to use EHRs. A McKinsey report on big data healthcare analytics states that “The integrated system has improved outcomes in cardiovascular disease and achieved an estimated $1 billion in savings from reduced office visits and lab tests.”\\n\\n3) Real-Time Alerting\\nOther examples of data analytics in healthcare share one crucial functionality – real-time alerting. In hospitals, Clinical Decision Support (CDS) software analyzes medical data on the spot, providing health practitioners with advice as they make prescriptive decisions.\\n\\nHowever, doctors want patients to stay away from hospitals to avoid costly in-house treatments. This is already trending as one of the business intelligence buzzwords in 2021 and has the potential to become part of a new strategy. Wearables will collect patients’ health data continuously and send this data to the cloud.\\n\\nAdditionally, this information will be accessed to the database on the state of health of the general public, which will allow doctors to compare this data in a socio-economic context and modify the delivery strategies accordingly. Institutions and care managers will use sophisticated tools to monitor this massive data stream and react every time the results will be disturbing.\\n\\nFor example, if a patient’s blood pressure increases alarmingly, the system will send a live alert to the doctor, who will then take action to reach the patient and administer measures to lower the pressure.\\n\\nAnother example is that of Asthmapolis, which has started to use inhalers with GPS-enabled trackers in order to identify asthma trends both on an individual level and looking at larger populations. This data is being used in conjunction with data from the CDC in order to develop better treatment plans for asthmatics.\", start_char_idx=4153, end_char_idx=9317, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This data is being used in conjunction with data from the CDC in order to develop better treatment plans for asthmatics.\\n\\n4) Enhancing Patient Engagement\\nMany consumers – and hence, potential patients – already have an interest in smart devices that record every step they take, their heart rates, sleeping habits, etc., on a permanent basis. All this vital information can be coupled with other trackable data to identify potential health risks lurking. Chronic insomnia and an elevated heart rate can signal a risk for future heart disease, for instance. Patients are directly involved in the monitoring of their own health, and incentives from health insurance can push them to lead a healthy lifestyle (e.g., giving money back to people using smartwatches).\\n\\nAnother way to do so comes with new wearables under development, tracking specific health trends and relaying them to the cloud where physicians can monitor them. Patients suffering from asthma or blood pressure could benefit from it, become a bit more independent and reduce unnecessary visits to the doctor.\\n\\n5) Prevent Opioid Abuse In The US\\nOur fifth example of big data healthcare is tackling a serious problem in the US. Here’s a sobering fact: as of this year, overdoses from misused opioids have caused more accidental deaths in the U.S. than road accidents, which were previously the most common cause of accidental death.\\n\\nAnalysis expert Bernard Marr writes about the problem in a Forbes article. The situation has gotten so dire that Canada has declared opioid abuse to be a “national health crisis,” and President Obama earmarked $1.1 billion dollars for developing solutions to the issue while he was in office.\\n\\nOnce again, an application of big data analytics in healthcare might be the answer everyone is looking for: data scientists at Blue Cross Blue Shield have started working with analytical experts at Fuzzy Logix to tackle the problem. Using years of insurance and pharmacy data, Fuzzy Logix analysts have been able to identify 742 risk factors that predict with a high degree of accuracy whether someone is at risk for abusing opioids.\\n\\nHealthcare big data can help in the fight against opioids abuse in the US and this image shows many pills stacked on a pile\\nTo be fair, reaching out to people identified as “high risk” and preventing them from developing a drug issue is a delicate undertaking. However, this project still offers a lot of hope for mitigating an issue that is destroying the lives of many people and costing the system a lot of money.\\n\\n6) Using Health Data For Informed Strategic Planning\\nThe use of big data in healthcare allows for strategic planning thanks to better insights into people’s motivations. Care managers can analyze check-up results among people in different demographic groups and identify what factors discourage people from taking up treatment.\\n\\nThe University of Florida made use of Google Maps and free public health data to prepare heat maps targeted at multiple issues, such as population growth and chronic diseases. Subsequently, academics compared this data with the availability of medical services in most heated areas. The insights gleaned from this allowed them to review their delivery strategy and add more care units to the most problematic areas.\\n\\n7) Big Data Might Just Cure Cancer\\nAnother interesting example of the use of big data in healthcare is the Cancer Moonshot program.

Before the end of his second term, President Obama came up with this program that had the goal of accomplishing 10 years’ worth of progress toward curing cancer in half that time.\\n\\nMedical researchers can use large amounts of data on treatment plans and recovery rates of cancer patients in order to find trends and treatments that have the highest rates of success in the real world. For example, researchers can examine tumor samples in biobanks that are linked up with patient treatment records. Using this data, researchers can see things like how certain mutations and cancer proteins interact with different treatments and find trends that will lead to better outcomes.\\n\\nThis data can also lead to unexpected benefits, such as finding that Desipramine, which is an antidepressant, has the ability to help cure certain types of lung cancer.\\n\\nHowever, in order to make these kinds of insights more available, patient databases from different institutions, such as hospitals, universities, and nonprofits, need to be linked up. Then, for example, researchers could access patient biopsy reports from other institutions. One of the potential big data use cases in healthcare would be genetically sequencing cancer tissue samples from clinical trial patients and making these data available to the wider cancer database.\\n\\nBut, there are a lot of obstacles in the way, including:\\n\\nIncompatible data systems. This is perhaps the biggest technical challenge, as making these data sets able to interface with each other is quite a feat.\\nPatient confidentiality issues. There are differing laws state by state which govern what patient information can be released with or without consent, and all of these would have to be navigated.\\nSimply put, institutions that have put a lot of resources and money into developing their own cancer dataset may not be eager to share it with others, even though it could lead to a cure much more quickly.\\nHowever, as an article by Fast Company states, there are precedents to navigating these types of problems and roadblocks while accelerating progress toward curing cancer using the strength of data analysis.\\n\\n8) Predictive Analytics In Healthcare\\nWe have already recognized predictive analysis as one of the biggest business intelligence trends for two years in a row, but the potential applications reach far beyond business and much further into the future. Optum Labs, a US research collaborative, has collected EHRs of over 30 million patients to create a database for predictive analysis tools that will improve the delivery of care.\\n\\nThe goal of healthcare online business intelligence is to help doctors make data-driven decisions within seconds and improve patients’ treatment. This is particularly useful in the case of patients with complex medical histories suffering from multiple conditions. New BI solutions and tools would also be able to predict, for example, who is at risk of diabetes and thereby be advised to make use of additional screenings or weight management.\\n\\n9) Reduce Fraud And Enhance Security\\nSome studies have shown that 93% of healthcare organizations have experienced a data breach. The reason is simple: personal data is extremely valuable and profitable on the black market. And any breach would have dramatic consequences. With that in mind, many organizations started to use analytics to help prevent security threats by identifying changes in network traffic or any other behavior that reflects a cyber-attack. Of course, big data has inherent security issues, and many think that using it will make organizations more vulnerable than they already are. But advances in security, such as encryption technology, firewalls, anti-virus software, etc., answer the need for more security, and the benefits brought largely overtake the risks.\\n\\nLikewise, it can help prevent fraud and inaccurate claims in a systemic, repeatable way. Analytical tools help to streamline the processing of insurance claims, enabling patients to get better returns on their claims and caregivers to be paid faster. For instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they saved over $210.7 million in fraud in just a year.\\n\\n10) Telemedicine\\nTelemedicine has been present on the market for over 40 years, but only today, with the arrival of online video conferences, smartphones, wireless devices, and wearables, has it been able to come into full bloom. The term refers to the delivery of remote clinical services using technology.\\n\\nIt is used for primary consultations and initial diagnosis, remote patient monitoring, and medical education for health professionals. Some more specific uses include telesurgery – doctors can perform operations with the use of robots and high-speed real-time data delivery without physically being in the same location as a patient.\\n\\nClinicians use telemedicine to provide personalized treatment plans and prevent hospitalization or re-admission. Such use of healthcare data analytics can be linked to the use of predictive analytics, as seen previously.

Patients can avoid waiting in lines, and doctors don’t waste time on unnecessary consultations and paperwork. Telemedicine also improves the availability of care as patients’ states can be monitored and consulted anywhere and anytime.\\n\\n11) Integrating Big-Style Data With Medical Imaging\\nMedical imaging is vital, and each year in the US, about 600 million imaging procedures are performed. Analyzing and storing these images manually is expensive both in terms of time and money, as radiologists need to examine each image individually, while hospitals need to store them for several years.\\n\\nMedical imaging provider Carestream explains how big data analytics for healthcare could change how images are read: algorithms developed analyzing hundreds of thousands of images could identify specific patterns in the pixels and convert them into a number to help the physician with the diagnosis. They even go further, saying that it could be possible that radiologists will no longer need to look at the images but instead analyze the outcomes of the algorithms that will inevitably study and remember more images than they could in a lifetime. This would undoubtedly impact the role of radiologists, their education, and the required skillset.\\n\\n12) A Way To Prevent Unnecessary ER Visits\\nSaving time, money, and energy using big data analytics for healthcare is necessary. What if we told you that over the course of 3 years, one woman visited the ER on more than 900 occasions? That situation is a reality in Oakland, California, where a woman who suffers from mental illness and substance abuse went to a variety of local hospitals on an almost daily basis.\\n\\nThis woman’s issues were exacerbated by the lack of shared medical records between local emergency rooms, increasing the cost to taxpayers and hospitals and making it harder for this woman to get good care. As Tracy Schrider, who coordinates the care management program at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland, stated in a Kaiser Health News article:\\n\\n“Everybody meant well. But she was being referred to three different substance abuse clinics and two different mental health clinics, and she had two case management workers both working on housing.  It was not only bad for the patient, it was also a waste of precious resources for both hospitals.”\\n\\nIn order to prevent future situations like this from happening, Alameda County hospitals came together to create a program called PreManage ED, which shares patient records between emergency departments.\\n\\nThis system lets the ER staff know things like:\\n\\nIf the patient they are treating has already had certain tests done at other hospitals, what the results of those tests are.\\nIf the patient in question already has a case manager at another hospital, prevent unnecessary assignments.\\nWhat advice has already been given to the patient so that a coherent message to the patient can be maintained by providers?\\nThis is another great example where the application of healthcare data analysis is useful and needed. In the past, hospitals without PreManage ED would repeat tests over and over, and even if they could see that a test had been done at another hospital, they would have to go old school and request or send long fax just to get the information they needed.\\n\\n13) Smart Staffing & Personnel Management\\nWithout a cohesive, engaged workforce, patient care will dwindle, service rates will drop, and mistakes will happen. But with big data tools in healthcare, it’s possible to streamline your staff administration activities in a wealth of key areas. By working with the right HR analytics, it’s possible for time-stretched medical institutions to optimize staffing while forecasting operating room demands, streamlining patient care as a result.\\n\\nToo often, there is a significant lack of fluidity in healthcare institutions, with staff distributed in the wrong areas at the wrong time. This imbalance of personnel administration could mean a particular department is either too overcrowded with staff or lacking staff when it matters most, which can develop risks of lower motivation for work and increases the absenteeism rate.', start_char_idx=16802, end_char_idx=22055, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Naturally, doctors and surgeons are highly skilled in their areas of expertise. But most medical institutions have a range of people working under one roof, from porters and admin clerks to cardiac specialists and brain surgeons.\\n\\nIn healthcare, soft skills are almost important as certifications. To keep the institution running at optimum capacity, you have to encourage continual learning and development. By keeping track of employee performance across the board while keeping a note of training data, you can use healthcare data analysis to gain insight into who needs support or training and when. If everyone is able to evolve with the changes around them, you will save more lives — and medical data analytics will help you do just that.\\n\\n15) Advanced Risk & Disease Control\\nBig data and healthcare analytics are essential for tackling the hospitalization risk for specific patients with chronic diseases. It can also help prevent deterioration.\\n\\nBy drilling down into insights such as medication type, symptoms, and the frequency of medical visits, among many others, it’s possible for healthcare institutions to provide accurate preventative care and, ultimately, reduce hospital admissions. Not only will this level of risk calculation result in reduced spending on in-house patient care, but it will also ensure that space and resources are available for those who need it most. This is a clearcut example of how analytics in healthcare can improve and save people’s lives.\\n\\nAs a result, big data for healthcare can improve the quality of patient care while making the organization more economically streamlined in every key area.\\n\\n16) Suicide & Self-Harm Prevention\\nGlobally, almost 800,000 people die from suicide every year. Plus, 17% of the world’s population will self-harm during their lifetime. These numbers are alarming. But while this is a very difficult area to tackle, big data uses in healthcare are helping to make a positive change concerning suicide and self-harm. As entities that see a wealth of patients every single day, healthcare institutions can use data analysis to identify individuals that might be likely to harm themselves.\\n\\nIn a 2018 study from KP and the Mental Health Research Network, a mix of EHR data and a standard depression questionnaire identified individuals who had an enhanced risk of a suicide attempt with great accuracy. Utilizing a predictions algorithm, the team found that suicide attempts and successes were 200 times more likely among the top 1% of patients flagged according to specific datasets. Speaking on the subject, Gregory E. Simon, MD, MPH, a senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, explained:\\n\\n“We demonstrated that we can use electronic health record data in combination with other tools to accurately identify people at high risk for suicide attempt or suicide death.”\\n\\nThis essential use case for big data in the healthcare industry really is a testament to the fact that medical analytics can save lives.\\n\\n“If somebody tortures the data enough (open or not), it will confess anything.” – Paolo Magrassi, former vice president, research director, Gartner.\\n\\n17) Improved Supply Chain Management\\nIf a medical institution’s supply chain is weakened or fragmented, everything else is likely to suffer, from patient care and treatment to long-term finances and beyond.

By doing so, medical institutions can thrive in the long term while delivering vital treatment to patients without potentially disastrous delays, snags, or bottlenecks.\\n\\n18) Financial facility management \\nAs you’ve learned by now, data plays a crucial role in today’s society. It has permeated industries across the world to assist in the development of new technologies and innovations. This is especially true in the business landscape, where data-driven initiatives have become a requirement rather than a choice. This is no different in the healthcare industry, which leads us to our next big data application. \\n\\nSo far, we’ve covered multiple applications related to patients and medical innovation. That said, all of these breakthroughs would not be possible if the finances of the different health organizations wouldn’t be on check. Big data in healthcare provides the necessary tools and knowledge to ensure optimal financial health across facilities, especially for big hospital networks that manage multiple facilities simultaneously. \\n\\nWhen we talk about the financial side of the healthcare industry, we’ll encounter similar KPIs as any other organization, such as net profit, cash flow, etc. However, there are some financial indicators that are unique to this sector. We are talking about drug costs,  claims denial rates, reimbursement rates, and much more. Keeping track of all those indicators is not an easy task; however, organizations that invest in software to collect, arrange and analyze their data will ensure their finances are in check and the facility remains profitable while providing the best care. \\n\\nThe example below is a hospital network dashboard generated with datapine’s dashboard designer. The template provides a strategic overview of a private hospital network with insights into multiple facilities. With these insights in hand, decision-makers can make informed decisions and spot improvement opportunities to boost their financial efficiency.\\n\\nHospital network dashboard as an application of big data in healthcare\\n**click to enlarge**\\n\\n19) Developing New Therapies & Innovations\\nThe next in our healthcare analytics examples centers on working for a brighter, bolder future in the medical industry. Big data analysis in healthcare has the power to assist in new therapy and innovative drug discoveries. By utilizing a mix of historical, real-time, and predictive metrics as well as a cohesive mix of data visualization techniques, healthcare experts can identify potential strengths and weaknesses in trials or processes.\\n\\nMoreover, through data-driven genetic information analysis as well as reactionary predictions in patients, big data analytics in healthcare can play a pivotal role in the development of groundbreaking new drugs and forward-thinking therapies. Data analytics in healthcare can streamline, innovate, provide security, and save lives. It gives confidence and clarity, and it is the way forward.\\n\\n20) Help To Manage And Track Mass Diseases \\nSince it started at the beginning of the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions and millions of people around the world. The widespread nature of this virus presented a challenge to the health industry, which found itself trying to learn from it and control it at the same time. In that context, big data played a fundamental role in the response given to this growing disease that made the world stop for years. \\n\\nSupported by advanced data management technologies, health experts were able to track in real-time how COVID was spreading, how fast it mutated under different conditions, as well as the effect it was having on the different world economies. This is done by analyzing massive data sets coming from diverse sources, such as medical records as well as individual human behaviors. For instance, looking at how many of them are staying at home, getting on the train, or going to school, as this highly influences how fast the virus spreads. \\n\\nPaired to this, technologies such as AI allowed various medical imaging modalities, such as X-rays, tomography, ultrasounds, and others, to provide an earlier diagnosis to patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

In fact, in 2020, the EU backed a software called InferRead to facilitate this process. Essentially, this AI-powered software “analyses images of the lungs taken by a CT scanner, identifies the signs of coronavirus, and assesses the lesions. The process would typically require a careful study by an experienced doctor, yet the machine needs only a few seconds”. This level of technology allowed hospitals around Europe to prevent the spread of the virus and, consequently, flatten the curve. \\n\\n21) Improved Drug Prescription Processes \\nAs seen throughout our list of examples, the vast amount of data that care professionals have at their fingertips has helped revolutionize patient care, disease control, and many others. That said, it is not a surprise that this trend has also spread into the pharmaceutical industry, where it promises to maximize the value of medicines and improve the quality of prescribing. This leads us to our next big data application in healthcare.\\n\\nOne of the companies applying it is Express Scripts, a third-party organization that manages medicines coverage for clients who provide health insurance plans. According to a publication from the Pharmaceutical Journal, the US-based company collected data from 83 million patients, which included everything from patients' clinical and behavioral characteristics, such as someone picking up a prescription, to Tweets directed at the company. With this data in hand, Express Scripts can predict important scenarios, such as who is likely to become addicted to a certain medication or who is not adhering to its treatment. If the last happens, the company immediately sends personalized interventions and support to make sure people adhere to their prescribed treatment. As a result, Express Scripts stated that they cut the non-adherence rate of hepatitis C patients from 8,3% to 4,8%. \\n\\n22) Prevent Human Error\\nFraud in the health industry can be considered anything from erroneous billings to inefficiencies that result in wasteful tests or even adding incorrect information to a person's medical record. In fact, the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that the financial losses due to healthcare fraud could reach $300 billion in the US alone. This means that around 10% of the total health spending is wasted due to fraud or human error. However, money is not even the biggest concern when it comes to human error and fraud, it's patients’ lives that are put at risk. Prescribing someone with the wrong medicine or treatment can result in long-lasting consequences or even death. \\n\\nTo avoid this, companies leverage big data and forecasting to identify and prevent fraud or human error quickly. For example, by analyzing massive amounts of prescription patterns, experts are able to detect prescription errors before they occur. The same happens with dosage ranges, tests, and other procedures. In time, this not only allows doctors and caregivers to trust in technology for their decision-making but also saves facilities a big amount of money while providing the best care. \\n\\n23) Alerting heart problems through personal devices \\nIn 2017, Apple and Stanford Medicine joined forces to carry out one-of-a-kind research called “Apple Heart Study.” They studied the heart rate sensor data of 400.000 Apple Watch users to see if wearable devices could help in detecting irregular heart rates to prevent fatal complications, especially atrial fibrillation (AFib).  \\n\\nAFib is among the leading causes of strokes across the world. Costing the life of approximately 130.000 people in the US every year, with another 750.000 hospitalizations. That’s because patients that are suffering from AFib often don’t experience any symptoms, so the condition can go unnoticed until it is fatal. \\n\\nAccording to Jeff Williams, Apple’s COO, the motivation to carry out this study was their own customer's testimonies. At the time, he said: “Every week, we receive incredible customer letters about how Apple Watch has affected their lives, including learning that they have AFib. These stories inspire us, and we're determined to do more to help people understand their health”\\n\\nApple and Standford Medicine created an app where any Apple Watch users in the US that were over the age of 22 could join the study. If an irregular heart rate were identified, the user would get a notification and a free doctor consultation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) patch for additional monitoring.\", start_char_idx=30434, end_char_idx=35416, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If an irregular heart rate were identified, the user would get a notification and a free doctor consultation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) patch for additional monitoring. After 8 months of testing using top-notch technology, in 2019, the results of the study were published. \\n\\nStanford Medicine found that only 0.5% of participants had irregular heart rate notifications, a positive result overall. Of the participants that did receive the notification, 84% were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of the notification. 34% of the participants that received a notification and followed up with an ECG patch were finally diagnosed with AFib. This last result was not surprising, as AFib can often go undetected. \\n\\nLastly, the study showed that comparisons between Apple Watch pulse detection and ECG patches pulse detection have a 71% positive predictive value. Showing that these devices can help people take charge of their health and, in some cases, save lives. A great testament to the power of big data in healthcare. \\n\\n24) Bluetooth helps asthma patients \\nAccording to the WHO, Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455 000 deaths globally. People who suffer from asthma can be triggered even by invisible particles in the air, making it a complicated disease to carry. \\n\\nWith those concerning numbers in mind, a Wisconsin-based digital health company called Propeller Health launched a Bluetooth-powered inhaler that can be connected to a person’s smartphone to collect data about the frequency of asthma attacks and the environmental conditions in which the person was located. \\n\\nOnce the inhaler is pressed, data about the time and location of the patient’s asthma attack is sent to an app on the phone via a Bluetooth sensor. Doctors can use this data later on to analyze the frequency of the attacks as well as any other factors such as location and weather. Plus, the inhaler is also set to help patients with their medication schedules since taking medication correctly and when expected can significantly decrease the chances of ending up in the emergency room for an attack. \\n\\nIn fact, research carried out by Propeller Health showed that 330 patients who had attached the Bluetooth sensor to their inhaler experienced 60% fewer asthma-related emergency hospital visits. The company also found that collecting data like this for patients that live in the same town or region can prove even more valuable. Another test of their Bluetooth inhaler sensor showed that in Louisville, Kentucky, asthma attacks were mostly caused by proximity to railroads and utilities. Plus, they found multiple asthma triggers in public areas. The data collected by the sensor is highly valuable to the city as health authorities can use it to prevent asthma from becoming a major issue for their population.  \\n\\nHow To Use Big Data In Healthcare?\\nAll in all, we’ve noticed three key trends through these 24 examples of healthcare analytics: the patient experience will improve dramatically, including quality of treatment and satisfaction levels; the overall health of the population can also be enhanced on a sustainable basis, and operational costs can be reduced significantly.\\n\\nLet’s have a look now at concrete examples of big data in healthcare:\\n\\na) Big Data In Healthcare Applied On A Hospital Dashboard\\nThis healthcare dashboard below provides you with the overview needed as a hospital director or as a facility manager.

This is key in order to make better-informed decisions that will improve the overall operations performance, with the goal of treating patients better and having the right staffing resources.\\n\\nb) Big Data Healthcare Application On Patients' Care\\nAnother real-world application of healthcare big data analytics, our dynamic patient KPI dashboard, is a visually-balanced tool designed to enhance service levels as well as treatment accuracy across departments.\\n\\nA big data in healthcare application of a patient dashboard displaying relevant metrics related to patient experience and care\\n**click to enlarge**\\n\\nBy offering a perfect storm or patience-centric information in one central location, medical institutions can create harmony between departments while streamlining care processes in a wealth of vital areas. For instance, bed occupancy rate metrics offer a window of insight into where resources might be required while tracking canceled or missed appointments will give senior executives the data they need to reduce costly patient no-shows.\\n\\nHere, you will find everything you need to enhance your level of patient care both in real-time and in the long term. This is a visual innovation that has the power to improve every type of medical institution, big or small.\\n\\nWhy We Need Big Data Analytics In Healthcare\\nBy looking at our list of most insightful medical big data applications, you should have a notion of how positive the use of analytics can be for this industry. If this is not clear yet, here we will summarize the main points of importance by listing a few benefits of big data in healthcare.  \\n\\nAs mentioned, there’s a huge need for big data in healthcare, especially due to rising costs in nations like the United States. As a McKinsey report states: “After more than 20 years of steady increases, healthcare expenses now represent 17.6 percent of GDP — nearly $600 billion more than the expected benchmark for a nation of the United States’s size and wealth.” This quote leads us to our first benefit. \\n\\nReducing costs \\n\\nAs stated above, costs are much higher than they should be, and they have been rising for the past 20 years. Clearly, we are in need of some smart, data-driven thinking in this area. And current incentives are changing as well: many insurance companies are switching from fee-for-service plans (which reward using expensive and sometimes unnecessary treatments and treating large amounts of patients quickly) to plans that prioritize patient outcomes\\n\\nAs the authors of the popular Freakonomics books have argued, financial incentives matter – and incentives that prioritize patients' health over treating large amounts of patients are a good thing. Why does this matter?\\n\\nWell, in the previous scheme, healthcare providers had no direct incentive to share patient information with one another, which made it harder to utilize the power of analytics. Now that more of them are getting paid based on patient outcomes, they have a financial incentive to share data that can be used to improve the lives of patients while cutting costs for insurance companies.\\n\\nReducing medical errors \\n\\nPhysician decisions are becoming more and more evidence-based, meaning that they rely on large swathes of research and clinical data as opposed to solely their schooling and professional opinion. That said, the risk of human error is always a latent threat. Even though doctors are highly trained professionals, they are still human, and the risk of selecting the wrong medication or treatment can potentially risk a person’s life. With the use of big data and the tools that we mentioned throughout this post, professionals can be easily alerted when the wrong medication, test, treatment, or other has been provided and remediate it immediately. In time, this can significantly reduce the rates of medical errors and improve the facility’s reputation.\\n\\nAs in many other industries, data gathering and management are getting bigger, and professionals need help in the matter. This new treatment attitude means there is a greater demand for big data analytics in healthcare facilities than ever before, and the rise of SaaS BI tools is also answering that need.\\n\\nOptimizing organizational and personnel management\\n\\nWhile using data to ensure you are providing the best care to patients is fundamental, there are also other operational areas in which it can assist the health industry.\", start_char_idx=38709, end_char_idx=43930, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This new treatment attitude means there is a greater demand for big data analytics in healthcare facilities than ever before, and the rise of SaaS BI tools is also answering that need.\\n\\nOptimizing organizational and personnel management\\n\\nWhile using data to ensure you are providing the best care to patients is fundamental, there are also other operational areas in which it can assist the health industry. Part of providing quality care is ensuring the facility works optimally, and this can also be achieved with the help of big data. \\n\\nBy using the right BI software, professionals can gather and analyze real-time data about the performance of their organization in areas such as operations and finances, as well as personnel management. For instance, predictive analytics technologies can provide relevant information regarding admission rates. These insights can help define staffing schedules to cover demand as well as inventory for medical supplies. This way, care facilities can stay one step ahead and ensure that patients are getting the best experience possible. \\n\\nGetting this level of insight in such an intuitive way allows managers to redirect resources where they are most needed and optimize areas that are not performing well to ensure the best return on investment possible.\\n\\nDrive innovation and growth\\n\\nOur last benefit is one that should be the clearest from the list of applications we provided earlier. The use of big data in the care industry enables professionals to test new technologies, drugs, and treatments to improve the quality of care given to patients and battle diseases that were once thought of as unbeatable.\\n\\nThanks to wearable devices that can tell your heart rate, Bluetooth asthma inhalers that gather insights to prevent attacks, and much more, doctors are able to use data to understand how common diseases work and how certain external factors might be affecting entire communities. Through that, they are able to provide personalized quality care to each and every person that goes into a hospital.\\n\\nThere is no denying that the power of big data analytics is saving lives. That being said, the process of managing data requires a lot of effort, and with that comes challenges, which we will discuss below.\\n\\nObstacles To A Widespread Big Data Healthcare\\nThe points mentioned above are just a few of the countless benefits of big data in healthcare. That said, with benefits also come limitations. In order to provide a full picture of the topic, we will now list a few obstacles and healthcare data challenges that organizations can face when implementing analytics into their processes.  \\n\\nData integration and storage: One of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of using big data in medicine is how medical data is spread across many sources governed by different states, hospitals, and administrative departments. The integration of these data sources would require developing a new infrastructure where all data providers collaborate with each other.\\n\\nData sharing: Equally important is implementing new online reporting software and business intelligence strategy that will allow all relevant users to be connected with the data. Healthcare needs to catch up with other industries that have already moved from standard regression-based methods to more future-oriented ones like predictive analytics, machine learning, and graph analytics. This is done with the help of modern reporting tools such as a dashboard creator that allows anyone to perform advanced analytics with just a few clicks easily. \\n\\nSecurity and privacy: Security and privacy are constant concerns are one of the biggest challenges of big data in healthcare.

However, reported data breach figures tell a different story, as cyberattacks continue to devastate the sector.\\n\\nIn 2023, more than 540 organizations and 112 million individuals were implicated in healthcare data breaches reported to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), compared to 590 organizations and 48.6 million impacted individuals in 2022.\\n\\nHealthITSecurity has compiled a list of the top ten biggest healthcare data breaches (by number of individuals impacted) reported to OCR this year. HIPAA requires covered entities to report breaches impacting more than 500 individuals to HHS-OCR within 60 days of discovery.\\n\\nLike last year, multiple breaches in 2023 originated at third-party vendors. What’s more, large-scale vulnerability exploits such as those waged against Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer software and Fortra’s GoAnywhere managed file transfer (MFT) solution heavily impacted healthcare organizations.\\n\\nBased on the breach disclosures outlined below, third-party risk management and vulnerability management will likely remain key focus areas in 2024.\\n\\nHCA HEALTHCARE: 11,270,000 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nHCA Healthcare, a large healthcare organization comprised of 180 hospitals and 2,300 ambulatory sites of care in 20 states and the United Kingdom, reported a breach to OCR in July.  \\n\\nThe breach occurred when an unauthorized party stole a list of information used for email messages to patients and posted it on an online forum. The list contained information used for email messages, such as appointment reminders and education about healthcare programs and services. The list consisted of 27 million rows of data.\\n\\nHCA Healthcare stated that the incident “appears to be a theft from an external storage location exclusively used to automate the formatting of email messages,” and it caused no disruptions to operations or care.\\n\\nThe list contained patient names, cities, states, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, gender, dates of birth, and appointment information. The breach did not involve clinical or payment information.\\n\\nThe company said it immediately disabled user access to the storage location and retained third-party investigators. \\n\\nPERRY JOHNSON & ASSOCIATES: 8,952,212 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nMedical transcription service Perry Johnson & Associates (PJ&A) disclosed a May data breach to impacted healthcare organization clients in November.\\n\\nAccording to the breach notice, PJ&A discovered a data security incident on May 2, 2023 and promptly launched an investigation. The company later determined that an unauthorized third party had maintained access to its systems between March 27 and May 2.\\n\\nThe unauthorized party may have obtained protected health information, including names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, hospital account numbers, admission diagnoses, addresses, and dates of service. The breach also included Social Security numbers, insurance information, and clinical information from medical transcription files, such as medication information and test results.\\n\\nFollowing PJ&A’s disclosure, Chicago, Illinois-based Cook County Health notified 1.2 million individuals that they may have been impacted by the breach. Upon learning of the incident, CCH said it terminated its relationship with PJ&A and stopped sharing data with the vendor.\\n\\nIn addition, Northwell Health, New York’s largest healthcare provider, notified patients of the breach, though it did not disclose the exact amount of individuals impacted. The incident later caught the attention of New York Attorney General Letitia James, who issued a consumer alert to warn New Yorkers about the potential impacts of the breach and encourage them to take steps to prevent identity theft.\\n\\nMANAGED CARE OF NORTH AMERICA: 8,861,076 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nManaged Care of North America (MCNA), a dental benefits administrator that provides services to Medicaid and CHIP programs across eight states, suffered a major healthcare data breach between February 26 and March 7 when its systems were infected with malicious code. Further investigation determined that an unauthorized party had accessed certain systems and removed copies of personal information.\\n\\nThe data involved in the incident ncluded protected health information (PHI) such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued ID numbers, health insurance information, Medicare/Medicaid ID numbers, group plan names and numbers, and information related to the dental and orthodontic care provided. The types of compromised information varied from individual to individual.  \\n\\nThe LockBit ransomware group claimed responsibility for the data breach, reportedly leaking a portion of the stolen data onto the dark web and holding the rest hostage for ransom.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5216, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Progress software disclosed the vulnerability on May 31 and issued a patch on the same day.\\n\\n“Welltok had previously installed all published patches and security upgrades immediately upon such patches being made available by Progress Software, the developer of the MOVEit Transfer tool,” Welltok stated in a notice to consumers.\\n\\n“Welltok also conducted an examination of our systems and networks using all information available to determine the potential impact of the vulnerabilities we were alerted to on the MOVEit Transfer server and the security of data housed on the server, and confirmed that there was no indication of any compromise at that time.”\\n\\nHowever, further investigation by Welltok determined that an unauthorized actor had in fact exploited the vulnerabilities and exfiltrated certain data from the MOVEit Transfer server. Welltok notified millions of consumers on behalf of 20 healthcare providers and plans, including Sutter Health, Mass General Brigham Health Plan, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Alabama, Kansas, and North Carolina, among others.\\n\\nThe information included in the breach may have included names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. A small number of Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and Medicare/Medicaid ID numbers were also impacted.\\n\\nPHARMERICA CORPORATION: 5,815,591 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nLong-term care pharmacy network PharMerica disclosed a breach to OCR in May that impacted more than 5.8 million individuals. PharMerica discovered suspicious activity within its network on March 14, 2023, later determining that an unknown party had accessed its computer systems and potentially obtained personal information.\\n\\nThe information involved in the breach included names, Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, medication information, and health insurance information. A breach notice provided to the Maine Attorney General’s Office was addressed to estate executors, meaning that some portion of the impacted individuals were deceased.\\n\\nPharMerica urged executors to request copies of the deceased individual’s credit report and to place alerts on the file with major credit reporting agencies.\\n\\nPharMerica said it had “no reason to believe that anyone’s information has been misused for the purpose of committing fraud or identity theft.”\\n\\nCOLORADO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE POLICY & FINANCING: 4,091,794 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nThe MOVEit Transfer hack also impacted millions of Colorado Medicaid beneficiaries by way of IBM.\\n\\nIBM is a third-party contractor of HCPF, which runs Colorado’s Medicaid program. IBM uses the MOVEit application to transfer files on behalf of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing (HCPF). In May, IBM notified HCPF of the MOVEit incident, prompting HCPF to launch an investigation.\\n\\n“While HCPF confirmed that no other HCPF systems or databases were impacted, on June 13, 2023, the investigation identified that certain HCPF files on the MOVEit application used by IBM were accessed by the unauthorized actor on or about May 28, 2023.

As previously reported, several United States senators sent letters to telehealth companies in February, including Cerebral, to address concerns over their health data privacy practices.\\n\\nSpecifically, the Senators raised issues surrounding reports that these companies have been tracking their customers’ sensitive health information and sharing it with third-party advertisers such as Meta and Google.\\n\\nIn March, Cerebral issued a breach notification stating that “like others in many industries, including health systems, traditional brick and mortar providers, and other telehealth companies, Cerebral has used what are called ‘pixels’ and similar common technologies (‘Tracking Technologies’), such as those made available by Google, Meta (Facebook), TikTok, and other third parties (‘Third-Party Platforms’), on Cerebral’s Platforms.”\\n\\nCerebral implemented these technologies when it began operations in October 2019 until it launched a review of its data sharing practices a few years later. On January 3, 2023, Cerebral determined that it had disclosed protected health information (PHI) to certain subcontractors “without having obtained HIPAA-required assurances.”\\n\\n“If an individual created a Cerebral account, the information disclosed may have included name, phone number, email address, date of birth, IP address, Cerebral client ID number, and other demographic or information,” the notice stated.\\n\\n“If, in addition to creating a Cerebral account, an individual also completed any portion of Cerebral’s online mental health self-assessment, the information disclosed may also have included the service the individual selected, assessment responses, and certain associated health information.”\\n\\nOther telehealth companies have faced enforcement actions from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), showing that the FTC is committed to cracking down on improper health data privacy and security practices.\\n\\nNATIONSBENEFITS HOLDINGS: 3,037,303 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED\\nNationsBenefits, which provides supplemental benefits administration services to healthcare plans, reported a breach to OCR in April that impacted more than 3 million individuals.

In this second post about data security regulations, we are turning our attention to healthcare.\\n\\nHealthcare, like other industry sectors, has become part of the new wave of digital transformation. The industry is heavily dependent on digital data, including highly sensitive patient data.\\n\\nTherefore, healthcare has been the target for cybercrime for many years; health information is a valuable commodity which is not lost on cybercriminals. According to HIPAA Journal, there were over 15 million health data records breached in 2018 in the U.S. alone.\\n\\nTo help control the leak of health data, regulations in the industry attempt to create frameworks and guidelines around securing data and consent in its use. In this article, we look at some of the most well-known regulations that help enforce data protection and privacy in the healthcare industry.\\n\\nRelated Post: Data Security Regulations Overview by Industry: Finance\\n\\n \\n\\nDisclaimer: This article is meant for introductory guidance only and summarizes the most commonly-cited data security regulations for the healthcare industry. It does neither claim to be an exhaustive list of all currently-applicable data security regulations across the globe, nor does it claim to provide legal/ compliance advice. For a full assessment of your organization’s regulatory context, please consult with a legal/ compliance professional.\\n\\n \\n\\nData Security Regulations for Healthcare (PHI)     \\nIn healthcare, the shared data can be of a particularly sensitive nature. It makes sense that there is robust data protection regulation that focuses on health data or Protected Health Information (PHI). PHI offers great value to any cybercriminal who steals it then sells it on.\\n\\n \\n\\nA TrustWave report into the value of black market data, sold via darknet sites, found that mean values of $250 per health record were a common occurrence. Regulations around the protection of PHI have their work cut out to control the lucrative exploitation of this valuable resource.\\n\\nThe U.S. has arguably the most robust and mature set of regulations that specifically protect health data, namely the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH).\\n\\n \\n\\nHIPAA: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\\nHIPAA sets out to create a framework that can be used to apply data protection to health data. It originated back in 1996 but has had several updates since then.\\n\\nThere are 18 identifiers that make up the health data covered by the HIPAA mandate that define what PHI is. These identifiers cover everything from name and geography to biometrics.\\n\\nThere are several rules that comprise HIPAA.\\n\\nHIPAA Security Rule\\nHIPAA Privacy Rule\\nHIPAA Transactions and Code Set Rule (TCS)\\nHIPAA Unique Identifiers Rule\\nHIPAA Enforcement Rule\\nHIPAA Breach Notification Rule\\nHIPAA Final Omnibus Rule\\nOf these five, two are particularly pertinent in data protection. These are the security rule and the privacy rule, as further described below.\\n\\n \\n\\n1.    HIPAA Security Rule\\nThe general requirements of this HIPAA Security Rule cover data integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. This includes using protection such as encryption and robust authentication for data access.\\n\\nAny and all data that is covered under the 18 identifiers, whether electronic or not, come under the remit of the law. All entities covered by HIPAA must put in place administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect PHI.\\n\\n \\n\\n.\\nAdministrative Safeguards\\nThis covers the strategic actions needed to protect PHI. So, typically, security policies and business procedures for protecting data. A security policy will set out the methods used in the physical and technical safeguards.\\n\\n \\n\\nPhysical Safeguards\\nThis is any method that can be used to control the security of physical systems. For example, a physical access control measure, like an electronic security system.\\n\\n \\n\\nTechnical Safeguards\\nThis covers the technical application of protecting data and is the most complex of the three safeguards. It includes the use of encryption and robust authentication.\\n\\nThere is also coverage of employee compliance training and awareness.\\n\\nThe use of risk assessments by covered entities is part of the security rule. The risk assessments help to identify areas of risk and so inform the use of best practices in those risk areas. This can also help in determining best practices for the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\\n\\nThe Office of Civil Rights (OCR) offers a tool to help with security assessments.\\n\\n \\n\\n2.    HIPAA Privacy Rule\\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule, augmented by the security rule, focuses on the right of the user to control what happens to their health data.\\n\\nThe security requirements of HIPAA cover administration, physical and technical aspects of data protection.\\n\\n \\n\\nOther HIPAA Rules\\nThe HIPAA Omnibus rule is another rule that allows the requirements under the two rules above to be applied across all business associate organizations.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5162, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

HIPAA Privacy Rule\\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule, augmented by the security rule, focuses on the right of the user to control what happens to their health data.\\n\\nThe security requirements of HIPAA cover administration, physical and technical aspects of data protection.\\n\\n \\n\\nOther HIPAA Rules\\nThe HIPAA Omnibus rule is another rule that allows the requirements under the two rules above to be applied across all business associate organizations. It is a way of inheriting and disseminating the protection of PHI across an entire vendor ecosystem.\\n\\nOne of the requirements of HIPAA is around breach notifications. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) manages a website, which is sometimes called the “Wall of Shame”. This site is so-called because health data breaches of over 500 users are displayed for all to see.\\n\\nThe HIPPA Omnibus Rule was an extension of HIPAA in 2013, to add Business Associates of Covered Entities to the list of organizations covered by the regulation. This means the security and privacy requirements of HIPAA are extended to those bodies.\\n\\nThe rule also covers areas such as the sale and marketing of PHI and the use of PHI in research. The rule also set out that genetic information cannot be used for insurance underwriting purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\nHITECH: The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act\\nThe focus of HITECH is on electronic health records (EHR). It was enacted in 2009 to cover the proposed increase in the use of electronic versions of PHI, aka ePHI.\\n\\nThe law is applicable to any organization that has set up an Electronic Health Record system. It requires that users are able to:\\n\\nHave access to their ePHI,\\nAssign their ePHI to a third-party recipient, and\\nGive consent to use and share ePHI except under three exclusions – for the use of treatment, payment, or health care operations.\\nSecurity audits are mandated by HITECH.\\n\\nSubtitle D of HITECH covers the security and privacy of ePHI. This section also sets out penalties for violations which can be up to $1.5 million.\\n\\nHITECH also has a stringent breach notification requirement. Section 13402(e)(4) of the HITECH Act requires that any breaches involving over 500 users must be notified. The OCR post this notice to their public portal.\\n\\nAlthough HITECH and HIPAA are separate laws, they do impact each other. HITECH specifically sets out that the technologies used for ePHI should not in any way override the security or privacy requirements of HIPAA.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe UK and Europe\\nAlthough HIPAA does not directly apply to the EU and the UK, other more general data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) are applied to health data.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe GDPR, for example, places “data concerning health” in the ‘special category’ for data.

These key purposes include treatment, payment, and health care operations.\\n\\nHow Can Patient Choice Be Implemented in Electronic Health Information Exchange (eHIE)?\\nWhile it is not required, health care providers may decide to offer patients a choice as to whether their health information may be exchanged electronically, either directly or through a Health Information Exchange Organization (HIE). That is, they may offer an “opt-in” or “opt-out” policy [PDF - 713 KB] or a combination.\\n\\nAre There Specific Legal Requirements for Opt-In or Opt-Out Policies?\\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) does not set out specific steps or requirements for obtaining a patient’s choice whether to participate in eHIE.  However, adequately informing patients of these new models for exchange and giving them the choice whether to participate is one means of ensuring that patients trust these systems.  Providers are therefore encouraged to enable patients to make a “meaningful” consent choice rather than an uninformed one. \\n\\nYou can read more about patient choice and eHIE in guidance released by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR): The HIPAA Privacy Rule and Electronic Health Information Exchange in a Networked Environment [PDF - 164KB].\\n\\nAre There Privacy Laws that Require Patient Consent?\\nYes.  There are some federal and state privacy laws (e.g., 42 CFR Part 2, Title 10) that require health care providers to obtain patients’ written consent before they disclose their health information to other people and organizations, even for treatment.  Many of these privacy laws protect information that is related to health conditions considered “sensitive” by most people.\\n\\nHow Does HIPAA Affect These Other Privacy Laws?\\nHIPAA created a baseline of privacy protection. It overrides (or “preempts”) other privacy laws that are less protective.  But HIPAA leaves in effect other laws that are more privacy-protective.  Under this legal framework, health care providers and other implementers must continue to follow other applicable federal and state laws that require obtaining patients’ consent before disclosing their health information.\\n\\nThe resources listed below provide links to some federal, state, and organization resources that may be of interest for those setting up eHIE policies in consultation with legal counsel.  Implementers may also want to visit their state’s law and policy sites for additional information.\\n\\nFederal, State, and Organization Resources about Consent, Personal Choice, and Confidentiality\\nWe encourage providers, HIEs, and other health IT implementers to seek expert advice when evaluating these resources, as privacy laws and policies continually evolve.

Organisations must ensure security systems such as encryption and firewalls protect patient records from unauthorised access. Sanctions for data breaches can be severe, with both loss of confidence in the provider and large fines from regulators.\\n\\nCompliance in the US – HIPAA\\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) covers several areas relating to health data, with one of the key requirements being a set of standards – the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule – to protect sensitive PHI from being disclosed without the patient’s consent.\\n\\nCompliance is regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services and enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which delivers annual reports to Congress on compliance and breaches.\\n\\nVendors of personal health records and third-party service providers not covered by HIPAA are pursuant to section 13407 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, implemented and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. This covers businesses with websites and apps that allow individuals to upload information to their medical records.\\n\\nImportantly, HIPAA does not necessarily consider a security breach to be a violation. Companies follow a set of standards to ensure risk is maintained at an ‘acceptable and appropriate level’ and enforcement occurs when these standards are not met.\\n\\nWhen such violations occur, the reputational damage and legal liability companies face for non-compliance can be severe. In February 2023, OCR announced a settlement with Banner Health Affiliated Covered Entities, Phoenix, Arizona, to resolve a data breach resulting from a hacking incident which had disclosed PHI of 2.81 million consumers.\\n\\nViolations specifically included lack of analysis to determine vulnerabilities to electronic PHI and failure to implement an authentication process to safeguard information. These breaches resulted in Banner Health paying out $1,250,000 to OCR and having to agree to implement a corrective action plan.\\n\\nEuropean compliance – GDPR\\nIn Europe, health data protection comes under the remit of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Recital 35, Health Data. This includes personal information collected during registration or the provision of health care services. Article 9 of the provision states that the subject must give explicit consent to the processing of personal data.\\n\\nThe European Commission has recently proposed an update, the ‘ePrivacy’ regulation which aims at reinforcing trust and security in the digital world. The proposal advocates stronger rules surrounding apps and metadata – data that describes other data and includes names and locations.\\n\\nAs with the US, data breaches in the EU are treated as violations if the company concerned is found to have not followed correct procedures. In May 2022, Dedalus Biologie was fined €1.5 million for a data breach involving nearly 500,000 people. Names, social security data and medical information (including genetic data) were released by bad actors onto the internet.\\n\\nThe French Lead Supervisory Authority identified three breaches, each of which failed to comply with the GDPR (Articles 28, 29, and 32).\\n\\nNew legislation for the UK\\nIn the UK, the Health Security Agency undertakes health protection activities on behalf of the government. Personal information can be shared with researchers who have approval from a medical ethics committee, but they must have a consumer’s consent or special permission from certain governmental offices. Known as ‘Section 251’, citizens can ‘opt-out’ of this arrangement.\\n\\nAs of April 2023, a new digital data protection rights bill is being progressed through the UK Parliament to replace GDPR following the UK’s departure from the European Union. Designed to increase consumer rights for data and metadata collected by apps, an early draft states that the new bill will enable the UK to strike new data partnerships while “providing clearer definitions on how consent is obtained for research.”\\n\\nArticle 6 of the bill covers the imposition of standards, accreditation, and enforcement (including financial penalties and public censure provision) for the Secretary of State.\\n\\nThe role of CMP software – compliance now and in the future\\nIn a recent survey by consent management platform (CMP) Cassie, three in four US consumers said that they were concerned about the security of their online health data. Despite this scepticism, the research revealed that most individuals are still willing to share their data with companies they trust.\\n\\nTo give healthcare providers the opportunity to focus on building patient trust, the Cassie CMP software provides full HIPAA and GDPR compliance. Cassie also provides a complete audit trail of all access permissions and changes, providing a convenient way to track, manage, and share data preferences and consents securely.', start_char_idx=1185, end_char_idx=6243, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Keeping patients' information secure and confidential helps build trust, which benefits the healthcare system as a whole. Maintaining privacy also helps protect patients' data from bad actors. Breaches can and do occur. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights keeps track of and investigates the data breaches that occur each year.\\n\\nData breaches affect various covered entities, including health plans and healthcare providers. They take the form of email hacks, unauthorized disclosure or access to medical records or email, network server hacks, and theft. Bad actors might want access to patient information for various reasons, such as selling the data for a profit or blackmailing the affected individuals.\\n\\nAnother reason data protection is important in healthcare is that if a health plan or provider experiences a breach, it might be necessary for the organization to pause operations temporarily. Pausing operations can mean patients need to delay or miss out on the care they need. Along with ensuring continued access to healthcare for patients, there are other reasons why your healthcare organization should do whatever it can to protect the privacy of your patient's health information.\\n\\n1. Avoid noncompliance penalties\\nRules and regulations regarding patient privacy exist for a reason, and the government takes noncompliance seriously. An organization that experiences a breach won't be able to shrug its shoulders and claim ignorance of the rules. Noncompliance penalties vary based on the extent of the issue. If an individual employee at a healthcare organization is responsible for the breach or other privacy issues, the employer might deal with them directly. That can mean the employee is terminated or suspended from their position for a period.\\n\\nIf noncompliance is something that takes place across the organization, the penalties can be more severe. They might include fines, civil charges, or in extreme cases, criminal charges.\\n\\nThe nature of the violation plays a significant role in determining how an individual or organization is penalized. There are four tiers to consider when determining the type of penalty that might apply.\\n\\nThe nature of the violation determines how an individual or organization is penalized\\n\\nTier 1\\nA tier 1 violation usually occurs through no fault of the covered entity. Often, the entity would not have been able to avoid the violation even by following the rules. Usually, the organization is not initially aware a tier 1 violation has occurred.\\n\\nThe fine for a tier 1 violation is usually a minimum of $100 and can be as much as $50,000. When this type of violation occurs, and the entity is not aware of it or could not have done anything to prevent it, the fine might be waived.\\n\\nTier 2\\nTier 2 violations include those an entity should have known about but could not have prevented, even with specific actions. Fines for a tier 2 violation start at $1,000 and can go up to $50,000.\\n\\nTier 3\\nTier 3 violations occur due to willful neglect of the rules. Willful neglect means an entity consciously and intentionally did not abide by the laws and regulations. An example of willful neglect occurs when a healthcare organization doesn't hand a patient a copy of its privacy practices when they come in for an appointment but instead expects the patient to track down that information on their own. Another example of willful neglect occurs when an individual working for a covered entity leaves patient information open on their laptop when they are not at their workstation.\\n\\nOrganizations that have committed violations under tier 3 have attempted to correct the issue. For that reason, fines are higher than they are for tier 1 or 2 violations but lower than for tier 4. The minimum fine starts at $10,000 and can be as much as $50,000.\\n\\nTier 4\\nA tier 4 violation occurs due to willful neglect, and the organization does not attempt to correct it. For example, an organization might continue to refuse to give patients a copy of the privacy practices, or an employee might continue to leave patient information out in the open. Fines for tier 4 violations are at least $50,000.\\n\\nCriminal violations\\nIn some cases, a violation can be classified as a criminal violation rather than a civil violation. The penalties for criminal violations are more severe than for civil violations. The Department of Justice handles criminal violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA). \\n\\nAs with civil violations, criminal violations fall into three tiers. The first tier includes violations such as the knowing disclosure of personal health information. The penalty is a fine of $50,000 and up to a year in prison. The second criminal tier concerns violations committed under false pretenses. The penalty can be a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4989, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Having to pay fines or spend time in prison also hurts a healthcare organization's reputation, which can have long-lasting effects.\\n\\nFinancial and criminal penalties are just some of the reasons to protect the privacy of healthcare information\\n\\n2. Build trust with patients and customers\\nA patient is likely to share very personal information with a doctor that they wouldn't share with others. It's critical to the trust between a patient and their provider that the provider keeps any health-related information confidential. \\n\\nThe trust issue occurs on the individual level and on a systemic level. Patients need to be reassured that medical information, such as test results or diagnoses, won't fall into the wrong hands. On the systemic level, people need reassurance the healthcare industry is looking out for their best interests in general. \\n\\nIt's critical that the provider keeps any health-related information confidential\\n\\nIf healthcare organizations were to become known for revealing details about their patients, such as sharing test results with people's employers or giving pharmaceutical companies data on patients for marketing purposes, trust would erode. People might be less likely to approach medical providers when they have a health concern. Delaying diagnosis and treatment can mean a condition becomes more difficult to cure or treat. It can also increase the chance of an illness spreading within a community.\\n\\nEnsuring patient privacy also reminds people of their rights as humans. The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to privacy and that laws should protect against any interference into a person's privacy. Keeping people's health data private reminds them of their fundamental rights as humans, which in turn helps to improve trust between patient and provider.\\n\\nRules and regulations of healthcare data privacy\\nSeveral regulations exist that protect the privacy of health data. Examples include the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to data more generally, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S. \\n\\nHIPAA\\nHIPAA was passed in 1996 to create standards that protect the privacy of identifiable health information. Before HIPAA, medical practices, insurance companies, and hospitals followed various laws at the state and federal levels. Some of those laws allowed patient information to be distributed to organizations that had nothing to do with a patient's medical care or medical treatment payment without authorization from the patient or notice given to them.\\n\\nBefore HIPAA, a health insurance company could give a lender or employer patient health information, for example. A lender could deny someone's mortgage application because of health issues, or an employer could decide not to hire someone based on their medical history. \\n\\nHIPAA gives patients control over their medical records. If a person is changing jobs and needs to change insurance plans, for instance, they can transfer their records from one health plan to the other with ease without worrying about their personal health information being exposed. The act also allows patients to decide who can access their medical records. A patient might give access to their primary care provider and a team of specialists, for example. They might choose to restrict access to their records to providers who aren't associated with their primary care provider's or specialist's practice.\\n\\nHIPAA consists of the privacy rule and security rule. The privacy rule dictates who has access to an individual's medical records and what they can do with that information. Under the security rule, a health organization needs to do their due diligence and work to keep patient data secure and safe. The security rule focuses on electronically transmitted patient data rather than information shared orally or on paper.\\n\\nIn addition to HIPAA, there are other laws concerning the privacy of patients' records and telehealth appointments.\", start_char_idx=4051, end_char_idx=9329, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

EHRs help increase efficiency by making it easier for authorized providers to access patients' medical records. They also make it easier for providers to share patients' records with authorized providers. \\n\\nAs with paper records and other forms of identifying health information, patients control who has access to their EHR. Organizations that don't comply with privacy regulations concerning EHRs can be fined, similar to how they would be penalized for violating privacy regulations for paper-based records.\\n\\nEHRs make it easier for authorized providers to access patients' medical records\\n\\nTelehealth and other technology\\nTelehealth visits allow patients to see their medical providers when going into the office is not possible. A telehealth service can be in the form of a video call, telephone call, or text messages exchanged between a patient and provider. While telehealth visits can be convenient for patients, they also have the potential to raise privacy concerns, as a bad actor can intercept a telehealth call or otherwise listen in on the visit.\\n\\nTelehealth visits should take place when both the provider and patient are in a private setting. A provider should confirm a patient is in a safe and private location before beginning the call and verify to the patient that they are in a private location. If the visit can't be conducted in a private setting, the provider should make every effort to limit the potential disclosure of private information, such as by speaking softly or asking the patient to move away from others.\\n\\nStrategies to secure health data \\nSince there are financial penalties for even unknowingly violating HIPAA and other privacy regulations, it's up to your organization to ensure it fully complies with medical privacy laws at all times. Fortunately, there are multiple tools available and strategies your organization can use to protect patient privacy and ensure compliance. \\n\\n1. Protecting key systems\\nTechnology is key to protecting confidential patient information and minimizing the risk of a breach or other unauthorized access to patient data. Your organization needs a content management system that complies with HIPAA while streamlining the process of creating, managing, and collaborating on patient data.\\n\\nThe Box Content Cloud gives your practice a single place to secure and manage your content and workflows, all while ensuring you maintain compliance with HIPAA and other industry standards.

Staying current with new regulations\\nThe regulations concerning patient privacy evolve over time. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services adjusted the requirements for telehealth visits to ensure greater access to medical care when many people were unable to leave home or were hesitant about seeing a provider in person. It's essential an organization keeps tabs on any changes in regulations to ensure it continues to comply with the rules.\\n\\nAn organization must keep tabs on changing regulations to ensure it maintains compliance\\n\\nUsing a cloud-based content management system that is HIPAA-compliant can make it easier for your organization to keep up to date on any changing regulations. The cloud-based file-sharing system should include features that ensure compliance and should be updated regularly to account for any changes in the rules.\\n\\nHow Box helps maintain HIPAA compliance\\nBox has been compliant with HIPAA, HITECH, and the HIPAA Omnibus rule since 2012.

Specifically, state and federal regulators want to close the gap between HIPAA-protected data and other consumer health data. HIPAA only regulates protected health information maintained by covered entities such as hospitals, clinics, health care providers, pharmacies, health plans and health care clearinghouses, and their business associates. Consumer health data collected by health apps and connected devices, however, is not necessarily protected by HIPAA. For these reasons, regulators have made it a priority to protect consumer health data as technology continues to advance.\\n\\nFoley’s cybersecurity and data privacy team provides a high-level overview of recent federal and state developments regarding the privacy and cybersecurity requirements for health data with a focus on applicability, data sale authorizations, and geofencing.\\n\\nFTC’s Proposed Changes to the Health Breach Notification Rule\\nOn June 9, 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comments on proposed changes to the Health Breach Notification Rule, with a deadline to submit written public comments on August 8, 2023. Specifically, the FTC would like the public to share their perspectives about how the agency should update the rule to reflect changes in technology, such as health apps and fitness trackers, and how consumers use those products.\\n\\nIn general, the Health Breach Notification Rule seeks to protect consumers’ personal health records (PHR) not subject to protection under HIPAA. The rule requires PHR vendors and PHR-related entities to provide notice to consumers, the FTC, and, in cases involving 500 or more consumers, the media following discovery of a breach.\\n\\nThe proposed changes to the Health Breach Notification Rule include revisions and additions to the definitions to clarify its application to health apps and other technologies not covered by HIPAA. The proposed rule clarifies the definition of “PHR identifiable health information” to make it clear the rule applies to health apps and similar technologies not covered by HIPAA. Further, the proposed rule expands the definition of a “PHR related entity” to expressly include organizations that offer products or services through any online service. The proposed rule also clarifies that a “breach of security” includes an unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health information that occurs as a result of a data security breach or an unauthorized disclosure. Among other things, the proposed rule clarifies what needs to be in a notice to consumers, such as the potential harm stemming from the breach and the names of any third parties that might have acquired the information.\\n\\nState Consumer Health Data Privacy Landscape\\n \\n\\nState legislatures are also focused on protecting consumer health data outside the scope of HIPAA. Washington, Nevada, and Connecticut have passed consumer health data privacy laws and it is likely other states will follow suit. Organizations should monitor these developments to understand their compliance obligations in these states. We highlight some of the interesting aspects of these new laws below.\\n\\nWashington’s My Health My Data Act\\nOn April 27, 2023, Washington’s Governor signed HB 1115, entitled the “Washington My Health My Data Act” (MHMDA), a landmark consumer health data privacy law that goes into effect March 31, 2024, for “regulated entities,” and June 30, 2024, for “small businesses.” The Washington Legislature drafted this law in response to the recent Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and the 14 states that banned abortion following Dobbs.\\n\\nThe MHMDA applies to “regulated entities” that conduct business in Washington or produce or provide services targeted to consumers in Washington and alone or jointly determine the purpose of collecting, processing, sharing, or selling consumer health data. Notably, unlike other state consumer privacy laws, the law does not contain a revenue threshold and it applies regardless of whether an organization collects consumer health data from a certain number of consumers or derives a certain percentage of revenue from selling consumer health data. Further, the law also applies to any “small business” that collects, processes, sells, or shares consumer health data of less than 100,000 consumers or derives less than 50% of its gross revenue from collecting, processing, selling, or sharing consumer health data, and controls, processes, sells, or shares consumer health data of less than 25,000 consumers. Finally, the law protects Washington residents and any persons whose data is collected within the state of Washington. As such, the MHMDA casts a wide net and will apply to nearly any entity that collects, processes, shares, or sells consumer health data in Washington.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5123, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Notably, the law does not contain a broad entity-level exemption for HIPAA-regulated entities as these entities should comply with this law to the extent that they maintain consumer health data distinguishable from HIPAA-covered data.\\n\\nFurthermore, the definition of “consumer health data” is defined broadly as “personal information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a consumer and that identifies the consumer’s past, present or future physical or mental health status.” The law further defines consumer health data in categories, such as:\\n\\nGeneral health data e.g., (1) individual health conditions, treatment, diseases, or diagnosis; (2) social, psychological, behavioral, or medical interventions; (3) surgeries or procedures; (4) use or purchase of prescribed medication; and (5) bodily functions, vital signs, symptoms, or measurements related to an individual’s physical or mental health status\\nGender-affirming care information\\nReproductive or sexual health information\\nBiometric data\\nGenetic data\\nPrecise location information\\nData that identifies a consumer seeking health care services\\nAny information that a regulated entity or small business, or their processor, processes to associate or identify a consumer with consumer health data that is derived or extrapolated from non-health information, such as proxy, derivative, inferred, or emergent data by any means, including algorithms or machine learning\\nThe scope of consumer health data is much broader than protected health information under HIPAA. Notably, the law’s definition of biometric information includes keystroke rhythms or patterns. As such, entities that use any type of keystroke data or similar tracking technologies should proceed with caution as it may be collecting consumer health data subject to the law’s various obligations.\\n\\nThe MHMDA places various obligations on organizations similar to other state consumer privacy laws. However, a couple of obligations are at top of mind for organizations. First, regulated entities and small businesses must obtain authorizations from consumers to sell their data. The data sale authorization requirements are like HIPAA authorizations with a few additional requirements, such as that authorizations expire after one year and the seller or purchaser of consumer health data must retain a copy of all valid authorizations for six years from the date of its signature.\\n\\nSecond, the MHMDA prohibits regulated entities from using geofencing around an entity that provides “in-person healthcare services.” Under the law generally, a geofence is a virtual boundary that is 2,000 feet or less from the perimeter of an entity that provides in-person health care services. The law broadly defines “healthcare services” to include any service used to assess, measure, improve, or learn about a person’s mental or physical health. As such, nontraditional health care entities, such as retailers, that use geofencing technology could potentially violate the law if such technology is used to serve consumers advertisements related to their health care or health care services.\\n\\nAlthough the MHMDA goes into effect March 31, 2024, the prohibition on geofencing goes into effect July 23, 2023. Organizations that collect consumer health data in Washington must be ready to comply with this prohibition later this month.\\n\\nNevada’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Law\\nOn June 16, 2023, the Nevada Governor signed SB 370, which creates a health data privacy law to protect consumer health data outside the scope of HIPAA.

Nevada’s law will go into effect March 31, 2024. The law applies to a “regulated entity” that conducts business in Nevada or produces or provides products or services that are targeted to consumers in Nevada and determines the purpose and means of processing, sharing, or selling consumer health data. There are many types of entities and information that are exempt from this law, such as HIPAA-regulated entities, GLBA-covered financial institutions and affiliates, certain information governed by 42 C.F.R. Part 2, information governed by FERPA, de-identified data in accordance with HIPAA, publicly available information, information that is used to provide access to or enable gameplay, and information used to identify the shopping habits or interests of a consumer, among others. Like the MHMDA, Nevada’s law protects Nevada residents and any person whose consumer health data is collected in Nevada.\\n\\nNevada’s law defines “consumer health data” as “personally identifiable information that is linked or reasonably capable of being linked to a consumer and is used by a regulated entity to identify the health status of the consumer.” Like the MHMDA, Nevada’s law further defines consumer health data in categories and includes, without limitation:\\n\\nGeneral health data e.g., (1) any health condition or status, disease, or diagnosis; (2) social, psychological, behavioral, or medical interventions; (3) surgeries or other health-related procedures; (4) the use or acquisition of medication; and (5) bodily functions, vital signs, or symptoms\\nGender-affirming care\\nReproductive or sexual health care\\nBiometric data\\nGenetic data\\nPrecise location information\\nAny consumer health data that is derived or extrapolated from information that is not consumer health data, including but not limited to, proxy, derivative, inferred, or emergent data derived through an algorithm, machine learning, or any other means\\nNevada’s law contains certain exemptions, obligations, and prohibitions, which are quite similar to the MHMDA. Nevada’s law requires written data sale authorizations like the MHMDA and contains a prohibition on geofencing. The law prohibits any person from using geofencing technology “within 1,750 feet of any medical facility” for the purpose of tracking consumers, collecting consumer health data, or sending notifications, messages, or advertisements to consumers related to their health data.\\n\\nConnecticut Amends the Connecticut Data Privacy Act to Include Consumer Health Data Privacy\\nOn June 26, 2023, the Connecticut Governor signed off on an amendment to the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) focused on consumer health data, among others. Originally, the amendment related to consumer health data was set to go into effect July 1, 2023, but the Connecticut legislature recently passed the state budget bill, delaying the effective date of the consumer health data provisions. These provisions will now go into effect October 1, 2023. The amendment is like the MHMDA in various ways and below we highlight a couple key requirements.\\n\\nThe amendment to the CTDPA seeks to protect “consumer health data,” which includes any personal data that a controller uses to identify a consumer’s physical or mental health condition or diagnosis. Like the MHMDA, the CTDPA amendment further defines consumer health data in categories, including gender-affirming health data and reproductive or sexual health data. Further, the CTDPA exempts various entities and information from its scope, as we previously addressed.\\n\\nAgain, like the MHMDA, the CTDPA amendment also contains a prohibition on geofencing.', start_char_idx=8417, end_char_idx=12872, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Specifically, to get started, organizations should conduct a data mapping exercise and assess how they collect, process, sell, or share health data to determine if their current operations will need to be adjusted to meet these new compliance obligations. As we only highlighted a few of the new requirements, organizations that process any consumer health data should review these new laws fully and continuously follow the changing landscape in this space.\\n\\nFor more information about complying with the Health Breach Notification Rule or state consumer health data privacy laws, please contact any of the partners or senior counsel in Foley & Lardner’s Cybersecurity and Data Privacy team.\\n\\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Lauren Hudon, a student at Marquette University Law School and 2023 summer associate at Foley & Lardner LLP.', start_char_idx=11922, end_char_idx=14521, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

       "['Understanding India’s New Data Protection Law\\nANIRUDH BURMAN\\nOCTOBER 03, 2023\\nPAPER\\nSource: Getty\\nSummary:  In early August 2023, the Indian Parliament passed the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023. This working paper analyzes the law and evaluates its development over more than half a decade of deliberations.\\nRelated Media and Tools\\nPrint Page\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIn early August 2023, the Indian Parliament passed the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023.1 The new law is the first cross-sectoral law on personal data protection in India and has been enacted after more than half a decade of deliberations.2 The key question this paper discusses is whether this seemingly interminable period of deliberations resulted in a “good” law—whether the law protects personal data adequately, and in addition, whether it properly balances, as the preamble to the law states, “the right of individuals to protect their personal data” on one hand and “the need to process such personal data for lawful purposes” on the other.\\n\\nTo answer this question, the paper first details the key features of the law and compares it to earlier versions, especially the previous official bill introduced by the government in Parliament in 2019.3 The second part of the paper then examines the DPDP Act from two perspectives. First, it highlights certain potentially problematic features of this law to understand its consequences for consumers and businesses as well as the Indian state. Second, it places the act in context of the developments and deliberations that have taken place over the last five years or so. The third part speculates on the key factors that will influence the development of data protection regulation in India in the next few years.\\n\\nThe 2023 act is the second version of the bill introduced in Parliament, and fourth overall. An initial version was prepared by a committee of experts and circulated for public feedback in 2018.4 This was followed by the government’s version of the bill that was introduced in Parliament in 2019—the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. This version was studied by a parliamentary committee that published its report in December 2021.5 The government, however, withdrew this bill, and in November 2022, published a fresh draft for public consultations—the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022.6 This draft was quite different compared to the previous versions. The 2023 law is based, in significant part, on this draft. However, it has some new provisions that are consequential for the questions this paper seeks to answer.\\n\\nAnirudh Burman\\nAnirudh Burman is an associate research director and fellow at Carnegie India. He works on key issues relating to public institutions, public administration, the administrative and regulatory state, and state capacity.\\nThese four drafts were preceded by a landmark 2017 judgment by India’s Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.7 The judgment declared that the right to privacy is part of the fundamental right to life in India and that the right to informational privacy is part of this right. The judgment, however, did not describe the specific contours of the right to informational privacy, and it also did not lay down specific mechanisms through which this right was to be protected.\\n\\nFollowing this, the first government version of the law, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, was introduced in Parliament in December 2019. This version was expansive in scope and proposed cross-sectoral, economy-wide data protection regulation to be overseen by an all-powerful data protection regulator—the Data Protection Authority (DPA). The 2019 bill provided for a preventive framework.8 It imposed a number of obligations on entities collecting personal data—to provide notice and take consent from individuals, to store accurate data in a secure manner, and to use it only for purposes listed in the notice. Businesses were also required to delete data once the purpose was satisfied and to provide consumers rights to access, erase, and port their data. Businesses were required to maintain security safeguards and transparency requirements, implement “privacy by design” requirements, and create grievance redress systems. Finally, this bill introduced an entity known as “consent managers,” who were intermediaries for collecting and providing consent to businesses on behalf of individuals.9\\n\\nThe bill grouped personal data into different categories and required elevated levels of protection for “sensitive” and “critical” personal data. Certain businesses were also to be categorized as “significant data fiduciaries,” and additional obligations were proposed for them—registration in India, data audits, and data impact assessments. In addition, the bill imposed localization restrictions on the cross-border flows of certain categories of data.',\n",

Certain businesses were also to be categorized as “significant data fiduciaries,” and additional obligations were proposed for them—registration in India, data audits, and data impact assessments. In addition, the bill imposed localization restrictions on the cross-border flows of certain categories of data. The DPA was empowered to impose penalties on businesses for violating these requirements. The bill also proposed to criminalize activities related to the deanonymization of individuals from anonymized datasets.\\n\\nThe 2019 bill exempted certain entities and businesses from notice and consent requirements under certain circumstances—for lawful state functions, medical and health services during emergencies or epidemics, breakdown of public order, employment-related data processing, the prevention and detection of unlawful activity, whistleblowing, and credit recovery, among others.\\n\\nThe 2019 bill also had a provision to empower the government to regulate nonpersonal data. It allowed the government to require private entities to hand over specific nonpersonal data that the government asked for as per conditions it prescribed. In short, the 2019 bill proposed a comprehensive, cross-sectoral framework based on preventive requirements for businesses (defined as “data fiduciaries”) and rights for individuals or consumers (“data principals”).\\n\\nThis regulatory structure was based mostly on the 2018 draft bill proposed by the Srikrishna Committee—the committee, chaired by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, a retired Supreme Court judge, was set up by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology in July 2017 to help frame data protection norms. The recommendations of this committee, in turn, were based on major regulatory developments that were popular while the work of the committee was proceeding. Primary among these was the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).10 While the general preventive framework of the 2019 bill was welcome, its expansive scope was problematic. It created a number of significant compliance requirements that would have affected both big and small firms in the economy. It also proposed the creation of a DPA that had significant regulation-making and supervisory powers. These regulations would have further detailed the already significant compliance requirements in the bill. The novelty of the law and the lack of prior experience in implementing a data protection law of this nature would have created serious risks of overregulation or under-regulation.11\\n\\nThe DPDP Act is based on the draft proposed by the government in November 2022, which adopted a radically different approach to data protection regulation.12 The next section details the key provisions of the act.\\n\\nKEY FEATURES OF THE DPDP ACT, 2023\\nCompared to the 2019 version of the bill, the DPDP Act, 2023 is more modest—it has reduced obligations for businesses and protections for consumers. On the one hand, the regulatory structure is simpler, but on the other, it vests the central government with unguided discretionary powers in some cases.\\n\\nApplicability to Nonresidents\\n\\nThe DPDP Act applies to Indian residents and businesses collecting the data of Indian residents. Interestingly, it also applies to non-citizens living in India whose data processing “in connection with any activity related to offering of goods or services” happens outside India.13 This has implications for, say, a U.S. citizen residing in India being provided digital goods or services within India by a provider based outside India.\\n\\nPurposes of Data Collection and Processing\\n\\nThe 2023 act allows personal data to be processed for any lawful purpose.14 The entity processing data can do so either by taking the concerned individual’s consent or for “legitimate uses,” a term that has been explained in the law.\\n\\nConsent must be “free, specific, informed, unconditional and unambiguous with a clear affirmative action” and for a specific purpose. The data collected has to be limited to that necessary for the specified purpose. A clear notice containing these details has to be provided to consumers, including the rights of the concerned individual and the grievance redress mechanism. Individuals have the right to withdraw consent if consent is the ground on which data is being processed.',\n",

A clear notice containing these details has to be provided to consumers, including the rights of the concerned individual and the grievance redress mechanism. Individuals have the right to withdraw consent if consent is the ground on which data is being processed.\\n\\nLegitimate uses are defined as: (a) a situation where an individual has voluntarily provided personal data for a specified purpose; (b) the provisioning of any subsidy, benefit, service, license, certificate, or permit by any agency or department of the Indian state, if the individual has previously consented to receiving any other such service from the state (this is a potential issue since it enables different government agencies providing these services to access personal data stored with other agencies of the government);15 (c) sovereignty or security; (d) fulfilling a legal obligation to disclose information to the state; (e) compliance with judgments, decrees, or orders; (f) medical emergency or threat to life or epidemics or threat to public health; and (g) disaster or breakdown of public order.16\\n\\nRights of Users/Consumers of Data-Related Products and Services\\n\\nThe DPDP Act also creates rights and obligations for individuals.17 These include the right to get a summary of all the collected data and to know the identities of all other data fiduciaries and data processors with whom the personal data has been shared, along with a description of the data shared. Individuals also have the right to correction, completion, updating, and erasure of their data. Besides, they have a right to obtain redress for their grievances and a right to nominate persons who will receive their data.\\n\\nObligations on Data Fiduciaries\\n\\nEntities responsible for collecting, storing, and processing digital personal data are defined as data fiduciaries and have defined obligations. These include: (a) maintaining security safeguards; (b) ensuring completeness, accuracy, and consistency of personal data; (c) intimation of data breach in a prescribed manner to the Data Protection Board of India (DPB); (d) data erasure on consent withdrawal or on the expiry of the specified purpose; (e) the data fiduciary having to appoint a data protection officer and set up grievance redress mechanisms; and (f) the consent of the parent/guardian being mandatory in the case of children/minors (those under eighteen years of age). The DPDP Act also states that any processing that is likely to have a detrimental effect on a child is not permitted. The law prohibits tracking, behavioral monitoring, and targeted advertising directed at children.18 The government can prescribe exemptions from these requirements for specified purposes. This is potentially a problem since the powers to exempt are broad and without any guidelines.\\n\\nWhile the 2023 act retains the broad categories of obligations for the most part, the key difference from the 2019 bill is the absence of the scope for the regulator, the DPA, to make detailed regulations on these obligations. In addition, the substantive requirements under each of these categories have been reduced.\\n\\nThere is an additional category of data fiduciaries known as significant data fiduciaries (SDFs). The government will designate data fiduciaries as SDFs based on certain criteria—volume and sensitivity of data and risks to data protection rights, sovereignty and integrity, electoral democracy, security, and public order.19\\n\\nSDFs will have additional obligations that include: (a) appointing a data protection officer based in India who will be answerable to the board of directors or the governing body of the SDF and will also serve as the point of contact for grievance redressal; and (b) conducting data protection impact assessments and audits and taking other measures as prescribed by the government. The 2019 bill required that SDFs register in India. This requirement has been removed from the 2023 act.\\n\\nModeration of Data Localization Requirements\\n\\nThe 2023 law reverses course on the issue of data localization. While the 2019 bill restricted certain data flows, the 2023 law only states that the government may restrict flows to certain countries by notification. While this is not explicit, the power to restrict data flows seems to be to provide the government necessary legal powers for national security purposes.',\n",

The law also states that this will not impact measures taken by sector-specific agencies that have or may impose localization requirements. For example, the Reserve Bank of India’s localization requirements will continue to be legally valid.\\n\\nExemptions From Obligations Under the Law\\n\\nThe law provides exemptions from consent and notice requirements as well as most obligations of data fiduciaries and related requirements in certain cases: (a) where processing is necessary for enforcing any legal right or claim; (b) personal data has to be processed by courts or tribunals, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any offenses; (c) where the personal data of non-Indian residents is being processed within India; and so on.20\\n\\nIn addition, the law exempts certain purposes and entities completely from its purview.21 These include:\\n\\nProcessing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, maintenance of public order, or preventing incitement to any cognizable offense. This will allow investigative and security agencies to remain outside the purview of this law.\\nData processing necessary for research, archiving, or statistical purposes if the personal data is not to be used to take any decision specific to a data principal.\\nThe government can exempt certain classes of data fiduciaries, including startups, from some provisions—notice, completeness, accuracy, consistency, and erasure.\\nOne problematic provision allows the government to, “before expiry of five years from the date of commencement of this Act,” declare that any provision of this law shall not apply to such data fiduciary or classes of data fiduciaries for such period as may be specified in the notification. This is a significant and wide discretionary power and is not circumscribed by any guidance on the basis for such exemption, the categories that may be exempted, and the time period for which such exemptions can operate.\\nNew Regulatory Structure for Regulating Data Privacy\\n\\nThe 2023 law completely changes the proposed regulatory institutional design. The 2019 bill proposed an independent regulatory agency. The DPA was proposed on the lines of similar government agencies in many EU countries that function independently of government and implement the GDPR. The proposed Indian DPA was arguably more powerful since it was proposed to have much more extensive regulation-making powers than DPAs under the GDPR. In addition to framing regulations, the DPA would have been responsible for framing codes of conduct for businesses, investigating cases of noncompliance, collecting supervisory information, and imposing penalties on businesses.\\n\\nIn contrast, the 2023 law establishes the DPB.22 The board is not a regulatory entity and is very different from the DPA. Compared to the latter, the board has a limited mandate to oversee the prevention of data breaches and direct remedial action and to conduct inquiries and issue penalties for noncompliance with the law.23 The board does not have any powers to frame regulations or codes of conduct or to call for information to supervise the workings of businesses. It can only do so during the process of conducting inquiries.\\n\\nThe members of the board will be appointed by the government, and the terms and conditions of their service will be prescribed in rules made by the government.24 The law states that these terms and conditions cannot be varied to a member’s disadvantage during their tenure.\\n\\nThe law allows the board to impose monetary penalties of up to 250 crore rupees (approximately $30.5 million).25 Appeals from the board’s orders will go to an existing tribunal— the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). In addition to monetary penalties, the bill allows data fiduciaries to provide voluntary undertakings to the board as a form of settlement of any complaints against them.26 Therefore, the board is a very different institution in design compared to the DPA.\\n\\nFinally, the 2023 law contains a novel provision not included or discussed in any previous version. This is Section 37, which allows the government, based on a reference from the board, to block the public’s access to any information that enables a data fiduciary to provide goods or services in India. This has to be based on two criteria: (a) the board has imposed penalties against such data fiduciaries on two or more prior occasions, and (b) the board has recommended a blockage.',\n",

The government has to provide the data fiduciary an opportunity to be heard before taking such action.\\n\\nANALYZING THE DPDP ACT, 2023\\nThis section analyzes the 2023 act from two perspectives. First, it explains the broad structure of the law and highlights its key features and issues. Second, it contextualizes the law in the background of the different drafts proposed before this and elaborates upon the deliberations that have led to it.\\n\\nHow Well Does the DPDP Act, 2023, Protect Privacy?\\n\\nThe 2023 act creates, for the first time, a data privacy law in India. It requires consent to be taken before personal data is processed and provides a limited number of exceptions that are clearly enumerated in the law. It provides consumers the right to access, correct, update, and erase their data, in addition to a right to nomination. It creates additional safeguards for the processing of children’s data. For businesses, it creates purpose limitations and obligations to provide notice of data collection and processing and mandates security safeguards. The law requires the creation of grievance redress mechanisms by businesses. The DPB will also handle complaints and grievances and is empowered to issue penalties for noncompliance with the law.\\n\\nFor the first time, therefore, India has a statutory framework for data protection. The presence of the law will gradually lead to the development of minimal standards of behavior and compliance among businesses that collect data. In this regard, the approach of the government toward implementing and enforcing the law will be the critical variable—for example, whether implementation will be focused on data-heavy businesses or across the economy would be an important factor.\\n\\nHowever, other than open questions related to implementation, there are some concerns with different provisions of the law and their potential for undermining the protections seemingly accorded in it.\\n\\nFirst, the exceptions carved out for consent empower the state significantly and place state imperatives on a different pedestal compared to private entities. While this may be truly legitimate in some circumstances, like disasters or emergencies, the law enlarges the scope of such circumstances. For example, Section 7(b) of the law enables the government to sidestep consent requirements where a government service beneficiary has previously consented to receiving any other benefit from the state. While this may allow easier access to personal data of beneficiaries for receiving government services, it also creates a potential for the government to aggregate databases. This is because making true use of the potential of this provision would mean that government agencies would have to be exempted from purpose limitations that require personal data to be deleted after the purpose of the data has been satisfied.\\n\\nAnother example of this is the set of exemptions to the state for investigative, prosecutorial, and national security purposes. In Section 17(1)(c), the law exempts the requirements of notice and consent, among others, for the purposes of processing for “prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of any offence or contravention of any law.”27 While this is understandable, Section 17(2)(a) subsequently provides a blanket exemption from the whole law to any government agency that the government may notify, in the interests of sovereignty, security, integrity, public order, and preventing incitement. Given the fact that Section 17(1)(c) already exists, Section 17(2)(a) only indicates the desire of Parliament to ensure a complete non-application of the data protection law to certain state agencies.\\n\\nProvisions like these create a separate category of activity that is beyond the purview of data privacy requirements. It is problematic that the Indian state is not subject to many of the constraints that private entities are, especially in cases where there is no pressing requirement for such an exception.\\n\\nSecond, the discretionary rule-making powers that the government has under the law could, in some cases, undermine the protections provided in the law. For example, under Section 17(5), the government has the power to declare that any provisions of this law will not apply to any business or class of businesses within five years of the commencement of the law.',\n",

For example, under Section 17(5), the government has the power to declare that any provisions of this law will not apply to any business or class of businesses within five years of the commencement of the law. There is no time frame for the operation of this exemption or any guidance on how this provision is to be used. An optimistic interpretation of this provision would suggest that this could be used to allow sunrise industries or startups some time to comply with the law. However, provision for this has already been made in Section 17(3), which provides limited exemptions to startups and other industries the government may notify. Therefore, Section 17(5) could potentially be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of the law. It is worth reiterating that the law only limits the government’s power to give these exemptions for an initial period of five years. It does not provide any limit on how long these exemptions can last for.\\n\\nSimilarly, the government has some unguided rule-making powers for exempting businesses from certain requirements regarding the processing of children’s data. Sections 9(1) to 9(3) specify certain requirements for the same—they require parental consent and prohibit profiling, among others. Section 9(4) allows the government to exempt any business or class of businesses from Sections 9(1) to 9(3) “subject to such conditions, as may be prescribed.” This provision, again, fails to indicate on what grounds this exemption will be given, how the conditions are to be determined, and so on. Since there is a lack of sufficient guidance, this provision is also subject to misuse.\\n\\nWhile there are other provisions where the government has powers to prescribe conditions and make substantive rules, the examples highlighted above provide almost no guidance. This is also problematic when judged against the tenets of Indian administrative law, which requires that laws should not confer unguided and excessive discretion on the implementing authority.28 If improperly used, such legal provisions are potentially in violation of the Indian Constitution.\\n\\nThird, the design of the DPB is problematic. The board is an independent agency with a limited mandate, and the government will create mechanisms for the selection and appointment of its members. While the law sets out qualifications for members, it does not state how many members shall be on the board and requires only one of them to be a legal expert. This last provision is a problem since one of the board’s main functions is to issue penalties and directions for noncompliance.\\n\\nIn addition, the chairperson of the DPB is empowered to authorize any board member to perform “any of the functions of the board and conduct any of its proceedings.” It is possible that the chairperson may not authorize the legal member of the board to conduct the proceedings leading up to the issuance of a penalty. This design also fails to maintain an internal separation of functions between the members conducting inquiries and the chairperson. Since the chairperson appoints members to conduct inquiries, they may potentially not discharge this function impartially in all cases.\\n\\nTherefore, while the DPDP Act creates data privacy protections in law for the first time, certain provisions in the law can effectively undermine its benefits if the government does not act under them in the most scrupulous manner possible.\\n\\nTracing the Evolution of the Debate on the Legislation\\n\\nThe DPDP Act is a remarkable shift in the approach toward data protection legislation compared to the 2018 draft bill and the 2019 bill introduced in Parliament. This shift was most visible in the November 2022 draft bill and has now been enshrined in the 2023 law. There are three major axes on which this shift is visible.\\n\\n1. Reductions in rights and obligations, and compliance: The 2018 and 2019 versions of the bill adopted a more expansive and all-encompassing framework toward data protection. As the preceding sections of this paper explain, many of these rights and obligations have been either diluted or discarded—data portability, for example, has been completely removed, while others such as the right to be forgotten have been recast to a simpler right to “erasure.”\\n\\nDetailed prescriptions regarding the contents of notices and privacy by design requirements, among others, have been discarded, and it is now up to businesses to translate these requirements.',\n",

As the preceding sections of this paper explain, many of these rights and obligations have been either diluted or discarded—data portability, for example, has been completely removed, while others such as the right to be forgotten have been recast to a simpler right to “erasure.”\\n\\nDetailed prescriptions regarding the contents of notices and privacy by design requirements, among others, have been discarded, and it is now up to businesses to translate these requirements. This is a better and more innovation-friendly approach. Given the lack of prior data protection law and jurisprudence, firms will experiment with different approaches to translate them into business practices. The practices that do not meet the requirements of the DPDP Act will be adjudicated in the DPB, the TDSAT, and the courts. This process will provide for an organic emergence of good practices suited to the Indian context.\\n\\nThis reduction in prescriptive requirements and overall compliance should also be seen in the context of the shift away from criminalization. The 2018 bill created a number of criminal offenses. The 2019 bill reduced this to just one—deanonymization. The 2022 draft and the 2023 version do not provide for any criminal offenses and stipulate only monetary penalties to be directed by the DPB.\\n\\n2. A sharper focus on data privacy: The 2018 draft, and more so the 2019 draft, included several provisions that were only tangentially related to data privacy. For example, the provision mandating the sharing of nonpersonal data did not further privacy interests in any way. Similarly, data localization requirements have been shown to have only a tangential relationship to data privacy, and better alternatives exist to achieve the same objectives. Their presence in the 2018 and 2019 bills were a source of uncertainty. In addition, data localization became a proxy for debates on issues such as data sovereignty, something that, again, is not directly related to the issue of privacy.\\n\\n3. The abandonment of a “regulatory” law: The 2018 and 2019 bills created a legislative framework that had a high degree of regulatory intensity—the bills provided a full-fledged independent regulator, the DPA, with extensive powers to frame regulations and codes of conduct on many provisions within those bills, such as notice and consent requirements, security safeguards, manner of storage of data, and so on. In addition, the DPA would have had powers to collect information necessary for ensuring compliance with the law and impose penalties for noncompliance. The DPA, therefore, was proposed to have many more touchpoints with the economy, and its mandate, by definition, required it to be relatively more interventionist.\\n\\nThese legislative proposals made the DPA a centerpiece of the regulatory framework, and the agency was expected to function like other Indian independent regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The DPA was expected to exercise these powers across all sectors of the Indian economy. It would have had to prescribe standards for all the legal provisions that provided for standard-setting requirements through regulations, modify and update them periodically, conduct the necessary stakeholder consultations across different economic sectors, create or identify research to support its regulatory agenda, and build its regulatory legitimacy. The proposed legislative role of the DPA in 2018 and 2019 was thus one of high regulatory intensity. Given this wide remit, it would have faced obvious challenges related to deciding on its overall approach, prioritizing among its many functions and objectives, and building the internal capabilities required to deliver on this expansive mandate.\\n\\nThe DPDP Act does away with the idea of an independent regulator like the DPA. The DPB does not have many regulation-making powers under this law. Its powers are limited to ensuring remedial actions against any data breaches and issuing directions to businesses requiring them to comply with the law. In addition, the DPB can pass orders issuing penalties or imposing voluntary settlements for noncompliance with the law. This is not a design that is “regulatory” in the same way as the proposed DPA in the 2018 and 2019 versions and is a major shift in approach. The DPB’s limited mandate will create less frequent touchpoints with the economy even though its orders regarding compliance or noncompliance will be extremely consequential.\\n\\nThese shifts have occurred incrementally over the last few years. The 2018 bill proposed an expansive law based closely on the GDPR.',\n",

The 2018 bill proposed an expansive law based closely on the GDPR. The 2019 bill rationalized some provisions while retaining most of them and adding to the regulatory expanse. It imported concerns that were at best tangential to privacy concerns in some cases. The 2022 bill and the 2023 act are a major shift away from this expansive framework. This indicates a change in how Parliament and the Indian government now view the salience of the data protection law to India’s economy. In 2017 and 2018, there were a few animating factors that led to the early versions of the bill. The Supreme Court had recently declared privacy to be a fundamental right and was about to rule on the constitutionality of India’s biometric ID project, Aadhaar. In addition, there was a global debate on data protection regulation sparked off by the impending implementation of the GDPR. The regulation was enacted in 2016 and came into force in 2018. At that point in time, it was viewed as a viable template for adoption and influenced deliberations on the Indian law.29\\n\\nBy 2022, the GDPR had been in effect for four years, and numerous issues with its design and implementation had been voiced.30 The Indian Supreme Court had upheld the use of Aadhaar for certain purposes and the potential constitutional law issues had been resolved. Arguably, deliberations on the different versions of the data protection legislation also allowed concerns about the proposed framework to be articulated consistently. This was especially visible on issues such as data localization.31 The long period of deliberations, therefore, allowed the shift to a more pragmatic version of the law to be finally enacted.\\n\\nHowever, one part of the government’s approach toward the law has remained noticeably consistent—the exemptions given for state functions. State surveillance agencies have been consistently exempted from the application of data protection requirements. The 2018 draft bill sought to narrow the scope of exemptions and proposed some checks and balances, which were diluted in the 2019 bill. The 2019 bill instead gave the central government the power to exempt any national security agency from any or all provisions of the proposed legislation. A similar provision has now been enacted into the law—other non-security-related government uses of data will continue to be exempted from certain parts of the law. Lastly, as pointed out earlier, the DPDP Act also gives the government problematic levels of unfettered discretion in some cases.\\n\\nThe next part of this paper speculates on how two developing strains of data-related regulation—the working of the data protection law and the concerns of national security and sovereignty—are likely to inform the next stage of data regulation in India.\\n\\nLOOKING FORWARD TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DATA PROTECTION LAW\\nNow that the DPDP Act is law, there will be three key sources of regulatory development under the same.\\n\\nThe first will be the rules framed by the central government to implement the law. The DPDP Act provides significant rule-making powers to the central government. These include:\\n\\nthe manner in which notices will be given to consumers;32\\nthe manner in which consent managers will function;33\\nthe manner in which businesses will inform their consumers and the DPB about data breaches;34\\nthe manner in which parental consent will be sought for processing children’s data and related exemptions;35\\nthe manner in which consumers will exercise their rights against data fiduciaries;36\\nthe manner of appointment of DPB members, the terms and conditions of their service, and the procedures for the functioning of the board;37\\ndata impact assessments and other measures to be taken by significant data fiduciaries;38 and\\nthe procedure to be followed by the appellate tribunal, the TDSAT, in hearing appeals from the DPB.39\\nThese are not insignificant powers. However, as already discussed, these powers of rule-making pale in comparison to the ones that were proposed to be given to the DPA under the previously proposed versions of the law.',\n",
       " 'These include:\\n\\nthe manner in which notices will be given to consumers;32\\nthe manner in which consent managers will function;33\\nthe manner in which businesses will inform their consumers and the DPB about data breaches;34\\nthe manner in which parental consent will be sought for processing children’s data and related exemptions;35\\nthe manner in which consumers will exercise their rights against data fiduciaries;36\\nthe manner of appointment of DPB members, the terms and conditions of their service, and the procedures for the functioning of the board;37\\ndata impact assessments and other measures to be taken by significant data fiduciaries;38 and\\nthe procedure to be followed by the appellate tribunal, the TDSAT, in hearing appeals from the DPB.39\\nThese are not insignificant powers. However, as already discussed, these powers of rule-making pale in comparison to the ones that were proposed to be given to the DPA under the previously proposed versions of the law. The intensity of regulation will, therefore, be much lower under the DPDP Act than it would have been under the 2019 bill. In creating this framework, the Indian Parliament has opted for a modest approach to creating elaborate rules and regulations. This will consequentially allow greater scope for experimentation and innovation in the Indian technology landscape relative to the 2019 bill and its predecessor.\\n\\nWhile many of these powers pertain to procedural issues, the central government has substantive rule-making powers as well. The fact that these rule-making powers are with the central government is problematic.\\n\\nThe most consequential of these is the power to grant exemptions. The exercise of this power will be contingent on two factors—the degree of technocratic competency within the relevant departments of the central government and the degree to which the relevant officers can function autonomously and technocratically. Historically, the Indian state’s response to improve competence and autonomy in economic regulation has been to move these functions to independent regulatory agencies. In this case, however, such powers have been retained with the central government.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the lack of any prior regulatory expertise on data protection also lends itself to an argument in favor of greater political inputs at an incipient stage of regulatory development. Historically, the Indian government directly regulated many subjects before transferring them to independent regulators and, in the process, developed a certain degree of institutional capability within the relevant departments. This has been the case for various subjects such as insurance, pension, telecom, electricity, and so on. While these departments did not necessarily regulate well, the exercise of these powers did create some technical and supervisory capacity within the relevant departments.\\n\\nThe critical consideration, therefore, is whether the drafters of the DPDP Act consider the framework under the law as a first step in the development of an independent regulator.\\n\\nThe second key source of regulatory development will be the decisions of the DPB in cases where it initiates an inquiry against regulated entities. The reasoning of the DPB and the penalties and directions it issues will be the first set of decisions on data privacy regulation under a new law. These decisions will not just contribute to jurisprudence on the subject but also provide guidance to businesses on how to implement and comply with the DPDP Act. The procedures the board follows, the quality of its reasoning, and the clarity of its decisions will shape both market behavior and future regulation in India.\\n\\nIn this regard, the composition of the board and the qualifications of its members conducting inquiries will be critical. The law has definite weaknesses in this regard, as discussed earlier. The proper implementation of the law will, therefore, depend on the government adopting best practices in appointment and selection and creating a culture of noninterference, since the law does not contain many standard provisions present in other Indian laws.\\n\\nThe third key source of regulatory development will be the directions that the DPB is empowered to issue under the law. While the DPDP Act requires the board to observe certain specified procedural rules while conducting inquiries and issuing penalties, it does not provide any such guidance for issuing directions to regulated entities. This is problematic since directions will also be binding and impose compliance costs. It is, therefore, appropriate that the board should create certain checks and balances for issuing directions. At the very least, the board should provide any regulated entity with a formal opportunity to furnish their response to a draft direction before such a direction is formally issued to them. Absent this, the board may develop a predilection toward regulation by direction.\\n\\nThe trajectory of these three strands of regulatory decision-making will significantly shape India’s technology markets and data-related policy for the next few years. Since the law does not contain adequate checks and balances, the onus will be on the central government to ensure that best practices in administrative law and decisionmaking are incorporated via the procedural rules that the DPDP Act empowers it to make.',\n",

Since the law does not contain adequate checks and balances, the onus will be on the central government to ensure that best practices in administrative law and decisionmaking are incorporated via the procedural rules that the DPDP Act empowers it to make.\\n\\nThe other main factor that will shape the development of data protection regulation will be the larger imperatives of exercising sovereign control over data and data businesses in India. The development of the DPDP Act was significantly influenced by the call to exercise control over Indian data for the benefit of Indians. This was most visible during the debate on issues related to data localization and nonpersonal data. While the provisions in the final law represent a significant moderation from the provisions in the draft proposals, the larger concerns over sovereignty and security will influence the development of this law.\\n\\nOne clear example of this is Section 37 of the law that enables the central government to block access to any information that can be communicated by a data fiduciary. This is a new insertion, and it is highly debatable whether this provision has any relevance to personal data privacy.\\n\\nOutside the DPDP Act, the evolving framework of laws regulating social media companies, IT services, and businesses, among others, will also exercise indirect influence on how data protection regulation develops. In 2021, the Indian government issued new guidelines for social media intermediaries that required, among others, measures to trace originators of social media content on over-the-top (OTT) messaging platforms. These requirements were challenged in courts and a final decision is awaited. The outcome will determine the nature and scope of the powers enjoyed by investigative agencies under the exemptions granted by the DPDP Act.\\n\\nAnother example is that of data localization. While the DPDP Act does not restrict data flows across borders, many Indian sectoral regulators, like the Reserve Bank of India, do impose localization requirements. The progressive adoption of localization by other regulators may make the liberal provisions of the DPDP Act superfluous.\\n\\nSome legal requirements aimed at regulating social media and big tech companies are emanating organically due to India’s rapid digital transformation in the past decade and the fact that the regulatory framework is outdated.40 India’s IT minister has stated that a replacement to India’s Information Technology Act, 2000 is in the works. This newer version of the IT Act, as well as other similar legislations, is also likely to influence the working of the DPDP Act. In each of these developments, it will be important to ensure that the nature and scope of sovereign control to be exercised is for a legitimate purpose and that it does not overserve the needs of the Indian state to the detriment of privacy, commerce, and innovation.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nWhile the DPDP Act is a culmination of more than five years of debate and deliberation, it marks the start of statutory personal data protection regulation. The regulatory developments and the institutional arrangements that take shape over the next few years will decide how well (or not) personal data privacy is protected. The new law provides the necessary scaffolding, but it is not sufficient for de facto data privacy to materialize.\\n\\nIt is debatable whether the earlier versions of the bill would have resulted in better privacy protection in any meaningful way.41 However, the transformation of the contents of different versions of the law is indicative of the changed approach of the government to privacy protection. The fact that the current version of the law, as compared to the earlier ones, imposes much lower costs on Indian businesses is positive.\\n\\nOverall, the law itself is modest and pragmatic. This is welcome. However, in some cases, it is exceedingly so, to the potential detriment of privacy interests. The fact that a significant degree of discretionary power on substantive issues is vested with the central government means that a lot will depend on how well the government is committed to protecting privacy.']"

       "['In addition to monetary penalties, the bill allows data fiduciaries to provide voluntary undertakings to the board as a form of settlement of any complaints against them.26 Therefore, the board is a very different institution in design compared to the DPA.\\n\\nFinally, the 2023 law contains a novel provision not included or discussed in any previous version. This is Section 37, which allows the government, based on a reference from the board, to block the public’s access to any information that enables a data fiduciary to provide goods or services in India. This has to be based on two criteria: (a) the board has imposed penalties against such data fiduciaries on two or more prior occasions, and (b) the board has recommended a blockage. The government has to provide the data fiduciary an opportunity to be heard before taking such action.\\n\\nANALYZING THE DPDP ACT, 2023\\nThis section analyzes the 2023 act from two perspectives. First, it explains the broad structure of the law and highlights its key features and issues. Second, it contextualizes the law in the background of the different drafts proposed before this and elaborates upon the deliberations that have led to it.\\n\\nHow Well Does the DPDP Act, 2023, Protect Privacy?\\n\\nThe 2023 act creates, for the first time, a data privacy law in India. It requires consent to be taken before personal data is processed and provides a limited number of exceptions that are clearly enumerated in the law. It provides consumers the right to access, correct, update, and erase their data, in addition to a right to nomination. It creates additional safeguards for the processing of children’s data. For businesses, it creates purpose limitations and obligations to provide notice of data collection and processing and mandates security safeguards. The law requires the creation of grievance redress mechanisms by businesses. The DPB will also handle complaints and grievances and is empowered to issue penalties for noncompliance with the law.\\n\\nFor the first time, therefore, India has a statutory framework for data protection. The presence of the law will gradually lead to the development of minimal standards of behavior and compliance among businesses that collect data. In this regard, the approach of the government toward implementing and enforcing the law will be the critical variable—for example, whether implementation will be focused on data-heavy businesses or across the economy would be an important factor.\\n\\nHowever, other than open questions related to implementation, there are some concerns with different provisions of the law and their potential for undermining the protections seemingly accorded in it.\\n\\nFirst, the exceptions carved out for consent empower the state significantly and place state imperatives on a different pedestal compared to private entities. While this may be truly legitimate in some circumstances, like disasters or emergencies, the law enlarges the scope of such circumstances. For example, Section 7(b) of the law enables the government to sidestep consent requirements where a government service beneficiary has previously consented to receiving any other benefit from the state. While this may allow easier access to personal data of beneficiaries for receiving government services, it also creates a potential for the government to aggregate databases. This is because making true use of the potential of this provision would mean that government agencies would have to be exempted from purpose limitations that require personal data to be deleted after the purpose of the data has been satisfied.\\n\\nAnother example of this is the set of exemptions to the state for investigative, prosecutorial, and national security purposes. In Section 17(1)(c), the law exempts the requirements of notice and consent, among others, for the purposes of processing for “prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of any offence or contravention of any law.”27 While this is understandable, Section 17(2)(a) subsequently provides a blanket exemption from the whole law to any government agency that the government may notify, in the interests of sovereignty, security, integrity, public order, and preventing incitement. Given the fact that Section 17(1)(c) already exists, Section 17(2)(a) only indicates the desire of Parliament to ensure a complete non-application of the data protection law to certain state agencies.\\n\\nProvisions like these create a separate category of activity that is beyond the purview of data privacy requirements. It is problematic that the Indian state is not subject to many of the constraints that private entities are, especially in cases where there is no pressing requirement for such an exception.\\n\\nSecond, the discretionary rule-making powers that the government has under the law could, in some cases, undermine the protections provided in the law. For example, under Section 17(5), the government has the power to declare that any provisions of this law will not apply to any business or class of businesses within five years of the commencement of the law.',\n",
       " 'The 2019 bill required that SDFs register in India. This requirement has been removed from the 2023 act.\\n\\nModeration of Data Localization Requirements\\n\\nThe 2023 law reverses course on the issue of data localization. While the 2019 bill restricted certain data flows, the 2023 law only states that the government may restrict flows to certain countries by notification. While this is not explicit, the power to restrict data flows seems to be to provide the government necessary legal powers for national security purposes. The law also states that this will not impact measures taken by sector-specific agencies that have or may impose localization requirements. For example, the Reserve Bank of India’s localization requirements will continue to be legally valid.\\n\\nExemptions From Obligations Under the Law\\n\\nThe law provides exemptions from consent and notice requirements as well as most obligations of data fiduciaries and related requirements in certain cases: (a) where processing is necessary for enforcing any legal right or claim; (b) personal data has to be processed by courts or tribunals, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any offenses; (c) where the personal data of non-Indian residents is being processed within India; and so on.20\\n\\nIn addition, the law exempts certain purposes and entities completely from its purview.21 These include:\\n\\nProcessing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, maintenance of public order, or preventing incitement to any cognizable offense. This will allow investigative and security agencies to remain outside the purview of this law.\\nData processing necessary for research, archiving, or statistical purposes if the personal data is not to be used to take any decision specific to a data principal.\\nThe government can exempt certain classes of data fiduciaries, including startups, from some provisions—notice, completeness, accuracy, consistency, and erasure.\\nOne problematic provision allows the government to, “before expiry of five years from the date of commencement of this Act,” declare that any provision of this law shall not apply to such data fiduciary or classes of data fiduciaries for such period as may be specified in the notification. This is a significant and wide discretionary power and is not circumscribed by any guidance on the basis for such exemption, the categories that may be exempted, and the time period for which such exemptions can operate.\\nNew Regulatory Structure for Regulating Data Privacy\\n\\nThe 2023 law completely changes the proposed regulatory institutional design. The 2019 bill proposed an independent regulatory agency. The DPA was proposed on the lines of similar government agencies in many EU countries that function independently of government and implement the GDPR. The proposed Indian DPA was arguably more powerful since it was proposed to have much more extensive regulation-making powers than DPAs under the GDPR. In addition to framing regulations, the DPA would have been responsible for framing codes of conduct for businesses, investigating cases of noncompliance, collecting supervisory information, and imposing penalties on businesses.\\n\\nIn contrast, the 2023 law establishes the DPB.22 The board is not a regulatory entity and is very different from the DPA. Compared to the latter, the board has a limited mandate to oversee the prevention of data breaches and direct remedial action and to conduct inquiries and issue penalties for noncompliance with the law.23 The board does not have any powers to frame regulations or codes of conduct or to call for information to supervise the workings of businesses. It can only do so during the process of conducting inquiries.\\n\\nThe members of the board will be appointed by the government, and the terms and conditions of their service will be prescribed in rules made by the government.24 The law states that these terms and conditions cannot be varied to a member’s disadvantage during their tenure.\\n\\nThe law allows the board to impose monetary penalties of up to 250 crore rupees (approximately $30.5 million).25 Appeals from the board’s orders will go to an existing tribunal— the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). In addition to monetary penalties, the bill allows data fiduciaries to provide voluntary undertakings to the board as a form of settlement of any complaints against them.26 Therefore, the board is a very different institution in design compared to the DPA.\\n\\nFinally, the 2023 law contains a novel provision not included or discussed in any previous version. This is Section 37, which allows the government, based on a reference from the board, to block the public’s access to any information that enables a data fiduciary to provide goods or services in India. This has to be based on two criteria: (a) the board has imposed penalties against such data fiduciaries on two or more prior occasions, and (b) the board has recommended a blockage.']"

The Act does away with the idea of having an independent regulator and instead establishes the DPB (Data Protection Board) as a regulatory entity. The DPB has the power to issue penalties or impose settlements for noncompliance with the law. The Act also requires the board to follow certain procedural rules when conducting inquiries and issuing penalties. \n",

The regulatory structure of the Act is based on the 2018 draft bill proposed by the Srikrishna Committee. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. Regulatory Powers: The DPB (Data Protection Board) under the DPDP Act has limited regulation-making powers. Its main role is to ensure remedial actions against data breaches and issue directions to businesses for compliance with the law. It can also pass orders for penalties or voluntary settlements for noncompliance.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Incremental Shifts: The development of the DPDP Act has occurred incrementally over the years. The 2018 and 2019 versions proposed an expansive law based on the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), while the 2022 and 2023 versions represent a more pragmatic approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "7. Sovereign Control over Data: The development of the DPDP Act was influenced by the larger imperatives of exercising sovereign control over data and data businesses in India. Concerns over sovereignty and security have influenced the law, including provisions related to data localization and blocking access to information.\n",

Influence of Other Laws: The evolving framework of laws regulating social media companies, IT services, and businesses in India will also indirectly influence the development of data protection regulation.

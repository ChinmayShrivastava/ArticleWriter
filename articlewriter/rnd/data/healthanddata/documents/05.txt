Impact: 3.3 million patients

How did the data breach occur?
In May 2020, Blackbaud, Trinity Health’s third-party vendor responsible for storing a backup of its donor database, fell victim to a ransomware attack attempt. Trinity Health, with the support of forensic experts and law enforcement, was able to successfully block the ransomware attack attempt, but not before the hackers exfiltrated a subset of data that included information linked to Trinity Health.

In violation of the F.B.I’s firm stance against cybercriminal compliance, Blackbaud paid the cybercriminal’s demand in exchange for the stolen database alongside a guarantee that any copies of the data would be permanently destroyed.

Because such a guarantee cannot be confirmed, Trinity Health treated the event as a highly probable data breach, ranking this event as the largest data breach in the healthcare industry in 2020.

In 2021, Trinity Health fell victim to another data breach impacting 586,869 patients. This incident was part of a large-scale data breach resulting from a cyberattack against third-party file transfer platform, Accellion.

What data was compromised?

According to Trinity Health, the following patient information was potentially compromised:

How did the breach occur?
OneTouchPoint is a third-party mailing and printing vendor that provided services mainly to healthcare organizations. OTP first noticed some of its files had been locked and decrypted in July 2022. After investigation, OTP concluded that their systems had been illegally accessed in the months prior. Shortly after, over 30 healthcare providers (including Blue Shield of California, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem, and Blue Cross) that had been clients of OTP began to report data breaches of its medical and patient records.

What data was compromised?
The following sensitive information was exposed in the breach:

Names
Addresses
Birthdays
Patient medical records (immunizations, allergies, vitals, medication, medical history)
Patient demographics
Employee employment dates
Employee ID numbers
Service descriptions and dates
Health assessment test results
Diagnosis codes
Learn from this data breach
Although OTP did not release the exact nature of the breach, the company is currently undergoing a class-action lawsuit by the medical firms claiming that OTP failed to safeguard sensitive medical information that could expose its patients to fraud and theft. Additionally, OTP failed to notify affected organizations and patients on time, despite finding out about the breach months before initial reporting.

To avoid incidents like these, businesses need to do an annual review of their security policies to ensure all safeguards are up to date and equipped to defend against evolving cyber threats. Furthermore, healthcare organizations working with third-party contractors need to ensure their business associates are HIPAA-compliant if they are handling sensitive patient information.
